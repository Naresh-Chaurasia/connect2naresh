      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about prioritizing your tasks so you are working on the most important, highest return tasks first and moving away from working on things you really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work on.
If we just manage our time, but haven&amp;rsquo;t prioritized what we need to do, we could find ourselves being very efficient working on the wrong things. If we have prioritized our tasks, but aren&amp;rsquo;t good at managing our time, we will know what we have to do, but be frustrated because we just aren&amp;rsquo;t getting to it</description>
