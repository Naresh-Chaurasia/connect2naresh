<blockquote>
<p>My Summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have to succeed personally, professionally, I have to choose the right habit, and positive thoughts. Everyone has setback in life, but how I choose to deal with it, will decide my future course of action. I always have a choice, to make right choice. With right habits I can succeed in relationships and my profession life as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Despite my lacklustre high school career, I still believed I could become a great player. And I knew that <strong>if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen</strong>. The turning point came two years after my injury, when I began college at Denison University. It was a new beginning, and it was the place where <strong>I would discover the surprising power of small habits</strong> for the first time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. <strong>These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled</strong> into the classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my first year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but <strong>consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But it was not until my senior season that <strong>my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training habits</strong> really began to pay off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to the hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team—an honour given to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic honour, the President’s Medal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I fulfilled my potential. And I believe the <strong>concepts in this book can help you fulfill your potential as well</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>We all face challenges in life</strong>. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. <strong>We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.</strong></mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. <strong>The only way I  made progress - the only choice I had - was to start small</strong>. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began working on this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To write a <strong>great book, you must first become the book</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and more—have been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently. My contribution, I hope, is to <strong>find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable</strong>. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits - <strong>cue, craving, response, and reward</strong> - and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioural  sciences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes the best way I know—an approach that will be effective regardless of where you start or what you’re trying to change. The strategies I cover will be relevant to anyone looking for a step-by-step system for improvement, <strong>whether your goals center on health, money, productivity, relationships, or all of the above</strong>. As long as human behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>04.Sep.2022</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chapter is very intense, very deep and lot of takeaways !!!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;the aggregation of marginal gains,&rdquo; which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of  improvement in everything you do</strong>. Brailsford said, &ldquo;The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then <strong>improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? <strong>Why do small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this approach in your own life?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis</strong>. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.</strong></mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, <strong>the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, <strong>but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. <mark>Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations</mark></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.</mark></strong> If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re moving slower than you’d like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits</strong>. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. <strong>You get what you repeat</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Productivity Compounds</strong>: Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. <strong>The effect of automating an old task</strong> or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital Declutter</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stress compounds</strong>. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these
common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge compounds</strong>. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a <strong>commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative</strong>. Furthermore, <strong>each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas</strong>. As Warren Buffett says, &ldquo;That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negative thoughts compound</strong>. <strong><mark>The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way</mark>. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships compound</strong>. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. <mark>It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed</mark></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the <strong>Plateau of Latent Potential</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.</mark></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Forget about goals. Focus on System Instead</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>November 15, 2021 : Changing job and getting 50% hike is a real life testimony of how the systems work. I kept on learning / working day after day, each day without any specific goal in mind. I just followed a system, and you can see the result yourself Naresh. Wow. It works.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set specific, actionable goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results? I think you would.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</mark></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.</mark></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem #1</strong>: Winners and losers have the same goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. <strong>When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level.</strong> Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. <strong>You can be satisfied anytime your system is running</strong>. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game</mark>.</strong> True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that
contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits - a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p>
</li>

<p>I have learned to be <strong>strategic</strong> about my reading, and manage my memory. I have developed some key reading, learning and memory recall skills. As for any habit change, the key is to form new habits in place of ineffective ones, and that requires initial practice and conscious effort. The good news is that this is easy to implement.</p>
<h3 id="my-reading-strategy-has-3-steps">My reading strategy has 3 steps:</h3>
<h4 id="1-scanning-the-territory-i-am-exploring-and-defining-my-learning-needs">1. Scanning the territory I am exploring, and defining my learning needs</h4>
<p>I always read with a clear purpose in my mind, which primes the brain to identify and prioritise the key ideas, and I only read books that serve my strategic purpose and which capture my interest and energise me. <strong>I don&rsquo;t waste time on poorly written or boring books, I just move on</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a very bad habit i.e. since I started, let me finish it. It is not serving me very well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="2-define-clear-goals-before-reading-every-book">2. Define clear goals before reading every book</h4>
<p>Set your intention and attention correctly, and you will remember more. Knowing in advance if you are reading to scan for ideas, or to deeply digest content that you know is worth mining for insight, is key. Low productivity is everyone&rsquo;s enemy, eating up our time unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Knowing some memory hacks will help you a great deal here.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="process-of-learning-from-books">Process of learning from books</h3>
<p>Before we start, let’s dispel a myth. When reading non-fiction, you don’t have to read one book at a time. Where did this idea even come from? Reading to learn should be goal-oriented, and it should be fuelled by energy and interest. So let’s unpack the process of learning from books.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-define-your-reading-radar-and-learning-needs">Step 1: Define your reading radar and learning needs</h4>
<p>The key to remembering the ideas and books that matter, is to deeply integrate the key ideas that are most useful to you. This is stating the obvious, but many <strong>people make the mistake of trying to read everything the same way and in the same depth</strong>. So by reducing your head clutter, you reduce the cognitive overwhelm that overloads and exhausts your mind.</p>
<p>So what does reading strategically mean? By being <strong>strategic</strong>, you will only study deeply the books (or chapters) that you will benefit from the most.</p>
<p>I am always scanning Amazon, blogs and other sources of book recommendations. I have a list of topic areas that are of interest to me, and I tell people that I know are knowledgable in these topics. Recommendations or discoveries that hit my radar get a quick scan of reviews on Amazon or Google, followed by a buy or leave decision. If you have Blinkist (a book summary app) then this is a great way to get a fast overview of a book, and short-cut this process. I keep a list of books on my radar, and I regularly review it.</p>
<p>If I have 3 or more books on my radar across all topics on my reading map, I will speed read them first (Google &ldquo;speed read&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll find resources and tips). On first pass I scan the contents pages, read the chapter summaries, and then flick quickly through every page scanning for diagrams, bullet points, and content headings for interesting clues. I will then selectively skim read parts of chapters, to evaluate quality and overlap with other books I&rsquo;ve scanned.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-define-clear-goals-for-reading-every-book">Step 2: Define clear goals for reading every book</h4>
<p>What are my reading goals? If I don&rsquo;t know, my interest is not peaked my brain is not primed to receive information in the right mode. So I will aimlessly wander into a book and potentially waste time.</p>
<p>When I moved to Spain from the UK, I had to learn the language fast, from scratch. I learned from my language teacher Rocio that there are two types of vocabulary: “passive” and “active.” Passive vocab are all the words that you understand when you hear them, but that you find hard to access when you want to express yourself. These words are on the tip of your tongue, but just beyond your recall. Active vocab is all the vocab you can use when try to express something, without thinking consciously or searching for words. With use, vocab becomes an automatic component of your repertoire for communicating and moves from passive to active.</p>
<p>Ideas and concepts are committed to memory in a similar way. So I read in one of three learning modes:</p>
<p><strong>Passive reading - to acquire general knowledge</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading for the pleasure of learning, and to stay up to speed and hope to stumble on great ideas and tools.</p>
<p>The goal for general knowledge reading is simply to enjoy the stimulation of new ideas, without the need to make copious notes or worry about forgetting things. I just accept that general knowledge reading enters into passive memory, and let go of worrying about recall. But if I sat down to recall the key topics and insights of the book, I might struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Active reading - to scan for solutions</strong></p>
<p>The brain will not let go of problems. They circulate round and round in your thoughts. That&rsquo;s why in GTD (Getting Things Done, the book by David Allen) he tells us for every to-do that we have, we should identify the first thing that needs to be actioned, and then commit when you will do it. Having done this, your brain will let go of worry, knowing that the task is scheduled. If you don&rsquo;t do this, your mind will be full of worry about all the things that you need to do.</p>
<p>Solution-seeking is easy because the brain wants to solve your problems. Relevant ideas and tools just jump out at you. The focus of reading is to first understand, and then capture solutions or ideas as they occur to you.</p>
<p><strong>Active reading - for deep integration</strong></p>
<p>This is reading to deeply integrate ideas that are valuable to your career know-how and life goals, and that add to your specialist expertise or professional insights. You want to commit this knowledge to long term “active” memory.</p>
<p>These are the books that your first scan suggested are worth deeply reading. Usually I find such books are harder reading material, either because their concepts and ideas are new or challenging to me, or because they are densely packed with research or tightly argued and complex. They demand more time to digest, and are worthy of the investment.</p>
<p>These books I will usually read at least twice, and hold for future reference. So my goal is to understand the ideas on the first reading, and capture content to return to. The second reading is to digest, evaluate and decide how to take action on the new knowledge. We want on the second reading to commit the key ideas to long term memory, using all the methods in Step 3.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-the-right-methods-to-connect-distill-and-chunk-ideas">Step 3: The right methods to connect, distill and chunk ideas</h4>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve identified books that we need to actively capture in longer term memory.</p>
<p>The heart of your reading strategy is your choice of methods for digesting and committing to memory what you learn. Note taking is the basic vehicle for most of us (unless you are Dyslexic like Richard Branson, or have a photographic memory like Elon Musk). I use mind maps extensively, plus I capture in the Evernote app all my bullet point summaries of key ideas or quotes and research references.</p>
<p><strong>I use mind maps to make connections, and mentally sort my ideas out</strong>. You can read more how I do this here: Tom Board&rsquo;s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.</p>
<p>I use Evernote for word-based note taking, in order to make my reading easily accessible in future, after my memory has faded. I can also structure captured ideas in folders for specific projects or further study. Evernote is fully searchable, even for PDFs and photographed hand-written notes. You can also tag notes, create folders, add web links, record audio, or use a digital pen on the iPad.</p>
<p>There are three main memory hacks that I use regularly, depending on the situation:</p>
<p><strong>Build a “mind palace”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is an ancient method, which I learned from one of Derren Brown&rsquo;s short audio books (Memory Tricks I think it was called). It goes like this. Think of a walk that you do often, and know intimately, or a house or other building that you similarly know inside-out. Then mentally associate places or rooms with what you want to remember, in the order you want to remember it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each subject is located in a place on your route, or a room in the building, and you use imagination to associate objects in your memory with the subjects you want to recall. The more outrageous the images, the better for memory recall. Run through mentally the rooms/walk until you can recall these images and subjects reliably. This method is used, I am told, by many TED speakers for presentations. It&rsquo;s useful if you need to recall information in a certain order, for a well-defined purpose. You can mentally &lsquo;clear&rsquo; your walk or palace once an event or situation has passed, and re-programme your mind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simplify and chunk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplification consists of distilling and prioritising what is important, and so de-cluttering the memory of the less important stuff to remember. You can use post-it notes, or just make lists, to sift and prioritise ideas. The ‘expert disease’ is to think that everything is important, and so discard nothing. This just overwhelms your short term memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chunking is a deeper method of ordering information so that you can hold more complex ideas in your short term memory, and think about them. Research shows that you have 3/4 “memory slots” in short term memory. If you try to hold more than 3/4 things in your head at once, you start to struggle. But chunking is a method of hacking this short term memory bottleneck, by grouping ideas. You can read more about chunking in the Quora post here: Tom Board&rsquo;s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Find helpful metaphors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our minds think in metaphors. Metaphors can be simple and generic like &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo; or broad like &ldquo;country&rdquo; or specific like &ldquo;the genome project&rdquo; or “waste basket” as in the Apple desktop or the physical bin in your office or study. You can associate metaphors with new ideas or concepts, to make them easier to recall.</li>
<li>If I say to myself that Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s book Tipping Point &ldquo;is like the moment I realise I&rsquo;ve eaten too much and my body diverts all its energy and resources to digestion, and my thinking goes fuzzy as my head feels lighter&rdquo; then I&rsquo;ve likened it to a physical body metaphor. If that metaphor is meaningful to me, it will be memorable.</li>
<li>Taking this further, if I want to convey ideas in a way that others will remember them, then I should choose familiar and universal metaphors to liken them too. Marketers use this trick all the time to introduce new products and services without triggering consumer&rsquo;s resistance to change and newness.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary, maintain a map of your reading territory consisting of the topics of interest and all the books on your radar. Speed read or scan them, or use a book summary service, to prioritise your reading. Then selectively read deeply, and throw all the memory tricks here at the key books so that you can access the knowledge you need, when you need it.</p>
<p>I would like to end on a simple idea that helps tremendously: be selective, and let go of guilt. Don&rsquo;t treat reading books like a challenge that must be overcome. Reframe your reading as meeting different goals, and take pleasure and time to read the books that really matter. You will have less mental clutter, more time, and enjoy the process far more. Best of luck.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the interesting fact is that almost all billionaires in the world have created their fortune through the stock market, either directly or indirectly. &ldquo;Directly&rdquo; refers to the direct stock investing and &ldquo;Indirectly&rdquo; refers to listing their companies on the stock market. One of the world’s richest persons, Warren Buffet created his fortune from direct stock investing while other well-known billionaires like Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook), Larry Page (founder of Google) made their fortune by listing their companies on stock market. Even in India, you will find many billionaire investors (e.g. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala) who created their entire wealth from direct stock investing.</p>
<p>As per statistics, 80% retail investors suffer overall loss from equity investment. Now, the most important point that arises is why maximum retail investors (small investors) lose their hard earned money in this market while a group of people are creating their fortune?</p>
<p>Net Profit and loss calculation from trading</p>
<p>This is one of the most important reasons of losing money in trading. The odds are against you. The system is designed in such a manner that it is next to impossible to make money consistently. Brokers, stock exchange and government – only they can earn consistently from trading. Every time you trade you need to pay all of them. They don’t bother whether you are gaining or losing. I hope now the reason is clear why your broker, media and several websites always encourage you to trade frequently. They all want to earn money for themselves, not for you. Do you still want to make them richer?</p>
<p><strong>The reality is that during the bear market, quality stocks are available at a cheap rate, and thus it is one of the best times to invest</strong>. Moreover, if you select quality stocks then overall market movement rarely matters. High-quality businesses are always poised to do well in any market situation. Don’t get carried away by any analysts.</p>
<p><strong>Overconfidence</strong></p>
<p>Suppose, you started investing during a bull market and successfully earned 45% return at the end of first year. All your purchased stocks were performing well. In such a situation, you may start thinking that you have mastered the subject very well. As the market moves up, so moves your confidence level, you keep on increasing your investment amount. You are now too aggressive. Suddenly market crashes and there comes a prolonged bear market. <strong>It is the bear market that separates intelligent investors from others</strong>. Don’t get lured and invest aggressively if you find your portfolio giving above average return during a bull market. The stock market doesn’t move linearly. It’s quite easy to make money during the bull run but difficult during the bear period. To become a successful investor, you need to learn the art of making money across all market situations.</p>
<p><strong>The only way to earn consistently from the stock market is to invest in the great business and hold them for the appropriate period</strong>. Check the details of any billionaire equity investor across the world. You will find one thing common to them. They simply chose high-quality stocks and remained invested over the long run. Warren Buffett, world’s most successful investor, and one of the world’s richest persons, created his fortune from 22% annualized return over more than 50 years from equity investing. He didn’t jump into intraday or Futures and Options. Just think, 22% annualized return consistently over 50 years creates a billionaire, and these trading tips providers claim 50%+ monthly return! What do you say?</p>
<p>Forget about intraday; short term trading, Futures &amp; Options. Remember, there is no shortcut to earning quickly. Every quick-money makings tricks are eventually money-losing tricks. Investing in high-quality stocks and holding them for the correct period is the only way to create wealth. This statement is easier to say than to execute. Here come the obvious questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by &ldquo;high-quality stocks&rdquo;?</li>
<li>How to select high-quality stocks?</li>
<li>How to separate quality business from others?</li>
<li>What is the correct holding period?</li>
<li>When to buy and when to sell a stock?</li>
<li>How to construct my portfolio?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Point to Remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The only way to accumulate wealth from the stock market is to invest in high-quality business (stock) and hold the same for the long run.</li>
<li>You can’t make money consistently via any form of short term trading. (Intraday, Futures &amp; Options, margin trade, etc.)</li>
<li>Your broker, stock exchange, and government can only become rich from short-term trading.</li>
<li>Don’t get tempted by fancy stories in the stock market.</li>
<li>Don’t invest in stocks with borrowed money. It carries a significant amount of risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-stock-market-is-not-risky-at-all">2. Stock Market is Not Risky at All</h3>
<p>For the person in the highest tax bracket, it is as high as 30.9%! Even if you are in the lowest tax bracket, then you need to shell out around 10% tax on the interest income from bank’s fixed deposit.</p>
<p>Well, many tax-efficient debt investment options are there which offers steady return and also serve the purpose of diversification. The problem is many of us are not aware at all.</p>
<p>Irrespective of educational background and specialization, anyone can learn the tactics of successful investing. It’s simple but not easy. &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; in the sense that it doesn’t require high intellectual. &ldquo;Not easy&rdquo; because it requires years of practice, discipline, dedication and willingness to learn.</p>
<p>Historically it is proved that only stock market and real estate investment can offer an above-inflation return in the long run.</p>
<p>Surprisingly in the stock market, investors are ready to trade frequently. A mere 10% rise in stock price tempts to book profit while 10% drop in stock price creates panic. The more you trade the chances of losing money will widen. If you can consider yourself as a partial owner of the business, then you can restrict yourself from frequent trading.</p>
<p>More than &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; you need to learn &ldquo;what NOT to do&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Points to remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Equity investing is not risky rather staying away from equity investment is risky.</li>
<li>After adjusting tax and inflation, bank’s fixed deposit yield a negative return.</li>
<li>Equity investment is the most convenient option for long-term wealth creation.</li>
<li>Investment in stocks is just like driving a car. If you can master the subject, it becomes easier.</li>
<li>Lack of knowledge is the primary reason for widespread misconception and lowest retail participants in the stock market.</li>
<li>A stock is nothing but a partial ownership in the business. Treat yourself as an owner of the business.</li>
<li>Before considering equity investment, invest in knowledge. Investment in knowledge pays the best interest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fist-step-of-picking-winning-stocks">3. Fist Step of Picking Winning Stocks</h3>
<p>Now, here is the big question - if we should put the least priority on profit and sales growth numbers then what will be our priority? The answer is Return on Equity (ROE). As a shareholder, you need to follow how promoters are utilising shareholder’s money. Are they creating value for their shareholders or themselves? Let’s have a look at the details of Return on Equity.</p>
<p>However, Return on Equity (ROE) offers an approximate view. Increasing ROE over the last 5-10 years with improved operating margin and cash flow is a signal of sustaining economic moat.</p>
<p>Debt to equity ratio is the measure of a company&rsquo;s financial leverage calculated by dividing its total liabilities by stockholders&rsquo; equity. It indicates what proportion of equity and debt the company is using to finance its assets. So, debt to equity ratio = Total Liabilities/Equity.</p>
<p>Before investing in any stock, have a look on its debt to equity ratio. The ratio is available on various financial websites. You need to check the ratio for at least last three years. Debt to equity ratio of greater than 1 (and increasing continuously) carries red signal. It emphasises that the company may face difficulties to serve debt in the near future. Don’t invest in companies where the ratio is above 1 and increasing rapidly over the last few years. Investing in high debt companies carries inherent risk. (Also note, debt to equity ratio is not relevant for banking and NBFC companies. There are different set of ratios for analysing banking and NBFC companies). In the following chart let’s have a look at the companies having high debt to equity ratio and their stock price performance.</p>
<p>After getting any stock idea, just figure out its Return on Equity (ROE) and Debt to Equity ratio. Profit and sales growth analysis will come later on. If you find the stock having ROE of less than 12% (and decreasing) and debt to equity ratio of more than 1 (and increasing), then discard it.</p>
<p><strong>Points To Remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Companies can alter profit and sales figures. So, the priority should not be on the profit and sales growth numbers.</li>
<li>There are plenty of stock recommendations are available here and there. Before following any of them just conduct a basic test of your own.</li>
<li>Return on Equity (ROE) is the single most important parameter to analyse a stock. Considering all other parameters remain same, higher the ROE better is the investment option.</li>
<li>Investing in companies with wide economic moat during their early stage can generate a multibagger return.</li>
<li>Companies can create economic moat by offering better products/service or utilising their brand strength or locking customers from competitors.</li>
<li>Increasing ROE over the last 5-10 years with improved operating margin and cash flow is a prominent signal of economic moat.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended to avoid high debt companies. Avoid stocks having debt to equity ratio more than 1 (increasing) and ROE less than 12% (decreasing over the last few years).</li>
<li>Higher debt translates into higher interest outgo that eventually minimises profits and erodes shareholders value.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We’ve lost sight of the simple but profound fundamentals of what it takes to be successful .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need new information — <strong>you need a new plan of action</strong> . It is time to create new behaviors and habits oriented away from sabotage and toward success . It’s that simple .</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-1-the-compound-effect-in-action">Chapter 1: The Compound Effect In Action</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t matter how smart you are or aren’t , <em>you need to <strong>make up in hard work</strong> what you lack in experience , skill , intelligence , or innate ability</em> . If your competitor is smarter , more talented , or experienced , you simply need to work three or four times as hard .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you aren’t good at something, work harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-2-choices">Chapter 2: Choices</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s the little things in life that will bite you .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have not been any more lucky or unlucky than anyone else . <strong>The difference is when luck came my way, I took advantage of it</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ( Complete ) Formula for Getting Lucky : Preparation (personal growth) + Attitude (belief / mindset) + Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) + Action (doing something about it) = Luck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attitude : This is where luck evades most people , and where Sir Richard is spot - on with his belief that luck is all around us. It’s simply a matter of seeing situations , conversations, and circumstances as fortuitous . <strong>You cannot see what you don’t look for, and you cannot look for what you don’t believe in</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the great defeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. <strong>Countless people have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you , and yet they’re wealthier and more fulfilled</strong>. Luck is an equal - opportunity distributor . Lady luck shines on all , but rather than having your umbrella overhead , you’ve got to have your face to the sky  When it comes down to it, it’s all you, baby. There’s no other way around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When I learned of the wrongdoings, I chose not to lose any more time fighting it. Instead, I licked my wounds, learned my lesson, and moved on</strong>. In hindsight, I’d make the same choice to pick up and move on again today .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I now challenge you to do the same. <strong>No matter what has happened to you, take complete responsibility for it — good or bad, victory or defeat</strong>. Own it. My mentor Jim Rohn said, <strong>&ldquo;The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Tracking Exercise</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep Track of your workout details</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This <strong>tracking exercise changed my awareness</strong> of how I related to my money. It worked so well, in fact, that I’ve used it many times to change other behaviors. Tracking is my go - to transformation model for everything that ails me. Over the years I’ve tracked what I eat and drink, how much I exercise, how much time I spend improving a skill, my number of sales calls, even the improvement of my relationships with family, friends, or my spouse. The results have been no less profound than my money - tracking wake - up call .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After hundreds of tournaments played and thousands of strokes tallied , the difference between the No . 1 – ranked golfer and the No . 10 golfer is an average of 0.32 strokes, but the difference in prize money is more than double ( $ 9.6 million versus $ 4.6 million ) ! The No. 1 golfer isn’t five times better, not even 50 percent or 10 percent better . In fact, his average score is only 0.5 percent better. Yet the results are more than double !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Even though you saved for many more years and invested much more cash, you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could have had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate and neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. Don’t wait another day to start the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The key is to start NOW</strong>. Every great act , every fantastic adventure , starts with small steps . The first step always looks harder than it actually is.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-3-habits">Chapter 3: Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life !&rdquo; the teacher exclaimed. &ldquo;The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to even try.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>From what we’ve already discussed , you know successful people aren’t necessarily more intelligent or more talented than anyone else. But their habits take them in the direction of becoming more informed, more knowledgeable, more competent, better skilled, and better prepared.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like Larry Bird, you can condition your automatic and unconscious responses to be those of a developed champion . This chapter is about <strong>choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits</strong>. It’s about becoming a creature of champion habits .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forget about willpower. It’s time for why - power</strong>. Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams. The wisest and most motivating choices are the ones aligned with that which you identify as your purpose, your core self, and your highest values. You’ve got to want something, and know why you want it , or you’ll end up giving up too easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well said. That’s why it’s not enough to choose to be successful. You have to dig deeper than that to find your core motivation, to activate your superpower. Your why - power .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can all make powerful choices . We can all take back control by not blaming chance, fate, or anyone else for our outcomes. It’s within our ability to create change. <strong>Rather than letting past hurtful experiences sap our energy and sabotage our success, we can use them to fuel positive, constructive change</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you define your goals , you give your brain something new to look for and focus on. It’s as if you’re giving your mind a new set of eyes through which to see all the people , circumstances, conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you. With this new perspective(an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside — your goal. It’s that simple. The difference in how you experience the world and draw ideas, people, and opportunities into your life after you have clearly defined your goals is profound. In one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way : <strong>“Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy. And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting blanks without written goals — and that’s the starting point.”</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I suggest that you take some time today to make a list of your most important goals. I recommend considering goals in all aspects of your life, not just for your business or finances. Be wary of the high price of putting too much focus on any single aspect of your life, to the exclusion of everything else. Go for whole - life success — balance in all the aspects of life that are important to you: business, finances, health and well - being, spirituality, family and relationships, and lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When most people set out to achieve new goals, they ask, “Okay , I have my goal; now what do I need to do to get it? ” It’s not a bad question, but it’s not the first question that needs to be addressed either. The question we should be asking ourselves is : <strong>“Who do I need to become?”</strong> You probably know some people who seem to do everything right, but still don’t produce the results they want, right? Why not ? One principle Jim Rohn taught me is : “If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. <strong>Success is something you attract by the person you become</strong>.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-4-momentum">Chapter 4: Momentum</h3>
<ul>
<li>But you set yourself up for failure by doing too much too soon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-5-influences">Chapter 5: Influences</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As you might guess, I don’t watch or listen to any news and I don’t read any news feeds or news publications. Ninety - nine percent of all news has no bearing on my personal life or my personal goals, dreams, and ambitions anyway. I have set up a few RSS feeds identifying the news and industry updates that do pertain to my direct interests and goals. The news that’s helpful to me gets plucked out of the fray so I don’t have to get any mud slung into my glass of water. While most people wade through hours of irrelevant garbage that hampers their thinking and crushes their spirit, <strong>I get the most productive information I need when I need it, in less than fifteen minutes a day</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I once had a neighbor who was deemed a three - minute friend . For three minutes, we could have a great chit - chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. I can hang out with an old high - school friend for three hours, but he’s not a three - day guy  And, then there are some people I can hang around for a few days, but wouldn’t go on an extended vacation with. <strong>Take a look at your relationships. Make sure you’re not spending three hours with a three - minute person</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You, too , can have almost any mentor you want</strong>, if he or she has gathered their best thoughts, stories, and ideas into books, videos, and podcasts . You have an unlimited bounty from which to draw. Take advantage of it. Now people often reach out to my assistant in order to get my advice or mentorship. All she has to do is tell them it’s all already available from anywhere in the world through DarrenDaily or inside our Darren Hardy Training Vault.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Technical Skills: Sergey Kargopolov, Stephane Marek</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Soft Skills: Dan Appleman, Josh Paulsen, Jonathan Levi, Jarad Hill</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to have a better, deeper, more meaningful relationship, ask yourself, <strong>“Who has the type of relationship I want? How can I spend (more) time with that person? Who can I meet who can positively influence me?”</strong> Let their glow rub off on you. <strong>Befriend the person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful person in your field. What do they read? Where do they go for lunch? How can that association influence you? You can build these expanded associations by joining networking groups and even online communities. Find the charity organizations, symphonies, and clubs where the people you want to emulate gather</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re never too good for a mentor . My friend Harvey Mackay told me , “I have had twenty coaches, if you can believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, I have a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” <strong>I have always found it interesting that the most successful people , the truly top performers , are the ones willing to hire and pay for the best coaches and trainers there are. It pays to invest in your improved performance</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Put another way, you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s amazing how life will organize around the standards you set for yourself</strong>. Some people think they’re the victims of other people’s behavior, but in actuality, we have control over how people treat us. Protect your emotional, mental, and physical space. Then you can live with peace, rather than in the chaos and stress the world will hurl upon you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-6-acceleration">Chapter 6: Acceleration</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But instead of quitting, every time I hit one of those mental and emotional walls, I recognized my competitors were facing the same challenges. I knew this was another moment when, if I kept going, I would gain strides ahead of them. These were the defining moments of success and progress. It wasn’t difficult, painful, or challenging when I was just running with the herd, just keeping up, but not really getting ahead. <strong>It’s not getting to the wall that counts. It’s what you do after you hit it that really matters</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s the extra effort after you have done your best that is the difference - maker. His team went on to win the game in the second half. That is how you win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When conditions are great, things are easy, there aren’t any distractions, no one is interrupting, temptations aren’t luring, and nothing is disturbing your stride. <strong>It’s not until situations are difficult, when problems come up and temptation is great, that you get to prove your worthiness for progress. As Jim Rohn would say , “Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better</strong>.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you hit the wall in your disciplines, routines, rhythms, and consistency, realize that’s when you are separating yourself from your old self, scaling that wall and finding your more powerful, triumphant, and victorious self.</p>
