<p><strong>This is why the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; workouts are often the most important ones</strong>. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.</p>

<ul>
<li>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. <strong>Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run</strong>.</li>
<li>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</li>
<li>Small changes often appear to make no <strong>difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient</strong>.
<ul>
<li>So many years will go by to get there. So many years will still go by even if you do not get there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.</li>
<li>If you want better results, then <strong>forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead</strong>.</li>
<li>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems
<ul>
<li>Build system for everything that is important.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-the-secret-to-self-control">7. The Secret to Self Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.
<ul>
<li>Things that you do not want to do, make it difficult to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.</li>
<li>People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
<ul>
<li>Make a list of my temptations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.</li>
<li>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="11-walk-slowly-but-never-backwards">11. Walk Slowly, but Never Backwards</h3>
<ul>
<li>The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.</li>
<li>The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.</li>
<li>Focus on taking action, not being in motion.</li>
<li>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.</li>
<li>The <strong>amount of time</strong> you have been performing a habit is not as important as the <strong>number of times</strong> you have performed it.
<ul>
<li>So, I don&rsquo;t have to wait for 6 months, 1 year etc. to become a good dancer. I can instead complete the reps in 3 months.</li>

<h3 id="16-how-to-stick-with-good-habits-every-day">16. How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day</h3>
<p>But perhaps the best way to <strong>measure your progress</strong> is with a <strong>habit tracker</strong>.</p>
<p>He explains that his goal is simply to &ldquo;<strong>never break the chain</strong>&rdquo; of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he feels. He is simply <strong>focused on showing up and adding to his streak</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one</strong>. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t.4 One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not.5 The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.</p>
<p><strong>The most effective form of motivation is progress</strong>. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire. <strong>This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made</strong>. Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get started because you don’t want to lose your progress by breaking the streak.</p>
<p><strong>This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of reward</strong>. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure. Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: <strong>you’re focused on the process rather than the result</strong>. You’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.</p>
<p><strong>Never Miss Twice</strong></p>
<p>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. <strong>Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This is why the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; workouts are often the most important ones</strong>. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.</p>
<p><strong>Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.</strong></p>
<p>In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most satisfying feelings is the <strong>feeling of making progress</strong>.</li>
<li>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like <strong>marking an X on a calendar</strong>.</li>
<li>Habit trackers and other <strong>visual forms of measurement</strong> can make your habits satisfying by providing <strong>clear evidence of your progress</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t break the chain</strong>. Try to keep your habit streak alive.</li>
<li>Never miss twice. <strong>If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible</strong>.</li>
<li>Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.</li>

<p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p>
<p>When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.</p>
<p>The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. <strong>You have to fall in love with boredom</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the <strong>edge of their current abilities</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom</strong>.</li>
<li>As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored.</li>
<li>Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. <strong>It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way</strong>.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I am doing all the things listed below. Kudos.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the Music</strong>: Dance is a three-way partnership between you, your partner and the music. Know the music well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take Lessons</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on rhythm patterns, not direction of movement</strong>: A step pattern—those fancy-looking moves that define a dance— is the bigger motion a couple makes on the floor. It combines a direction, which is where to move, with a rhythm pattern, which is when to make weight changes. A rhythm pattern, which can be practiced by stepping in place (also known as marking a rhythm), has to do with whether you step or don’t step on a beat of music and whether you get fancy and step between beats of music, not the geography created when you move around the floor. <strong>For the beginner, I believe understanding when to step (rhythm patterns) is far more important than where to step (direction).</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on technique, not learning more step patterns</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get Out and Dance</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dance with a Variety of Partners</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dance Up</strong>: By dancing up I mean asking better dancers than you to dance. When you dance up, miraculously, things begin to work, and you’re able to move to the next level. You should dance up, occasionally, if you want to progress at a reasonable rate.</p>

<h3 id="1-the-beat-of-the-music">1. The Beat of the Music</h3>
<p>My breakthrough in hearing the beat (I use hearing the beat synonymously with feeling the beat unless the context suggests otherwise) came <strong>when I was able to hear that not all beats are equal, that some beats hit the ear differently than others</strong>. Some beats are accented. That is, they stand out; and the degree and type of emphasis can vary. Typically, accented beats are just louder, with more oomph, as if instruments or vocals are hitting the note on that beat harder. But some beats sound different because they identify beginning points, like the start of a verse or a chorus or other, more subtle, thematic elements in the music. To my untrained ear I didn’t always know why a beat sounded different; but, regardless of the reason, <strong>just hearing that not all beats sound the same is what I found to be important</strong>.</p>
<p>The neat thing about these different beats is that, if you listen carefully, they create simple, regularly occurring sequences. Yes, it was subtle; but in the background these different beats created patterns. Once I began to hear these arrangements, the beats began to show some distinction. <strong>They came alive</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>I believe learning to count, both the music and step patterns, is the gateway to intermediate-level dancing and above.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Counting</strong> music is counting the underlying beats of the music. Doing so reveals the structure of the music. It pertains only to the structure of the music—not the step pattern being danced—and virtually all dance music is counted the same.</p>
<p>This is the only thing you need to know: virtually all dance music is counted in sets of 8 beats. It’s as simple as that. Sets of 8 exist because that’s how musicians compose the music; it’s how they give structure to the music.</p>
<p>He counted the music in sets of 8 beats. He counted 8 beats of music—&ldquo;one two three four five six seven eight&rdquo;—and then started over. <strong>He emphasized each count 1 of the music, the first beat of each set of 8, by punching the air with his hand. (And, to a lesser degree, he also emphasized each count 5, the fifth beat of a set of 8, with a smaller punch.)</strong> With the help of his hand motions I could hear that all the count 1s were, indeed, naturally emphasized in the music. (Lingo Alert: Sometimes the word &ldquo;count&rdquo; is omitted and a count 1 is identified as &ldquo;the 1 of the music&rdquo; or just &ldquo;the 1.&rdquo;) Moreover, I could hear that the 1s were beginning points that signaled the beginning of something new in the melody. The concept of a beginning point was subtle; but if someone identified it for me, I could hear it.</p>
<p>All dance music, <strong>except waltz</strong>, shares a similar structure. Heck, most popular music, even the gnarliest rock or rap you’ve ever heard, probably shares the same repeatable, predictable sets of 8 as dance music.</p>
<p>For me, hearing sets of 8 is a two-part approach. First, using a more left-brain-linear-analytical approach, I try to identify the count 1s, the first beat of a set of 8. <strong>A count 1 stands out because it typically has an emphasis or accent. It also stands out because it’s a beginning point for a piece of the melody or other thematic element; it sounds like a natural place to start something. It’s the same type of feeling you get at the start of a new sentence</strong>.</p>
<p>Even after I realized that sets of 8 existed, it took many, many months of listening and practicing and getting confirmation from others before I could hear the structure and it became second nature. Until I could confidently count sets of 8, I was never 100 percent certain I was on the beat.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE 1: COUNT SETS OF 8</strong></p>
<p>To get started, spend time with a teacher or friend listening to a variety of music. You can listen to your own music collection; but also surf the radio dial and music websites that let you sample music, as listening to unfamiliar songs is an important part of the process. Count the sets of 8. If a song stumps you, move on quickly, because you have to hear it in the easy pieces before you can hear it in the harder stuff. Do the count 1s stand out? <strong>Do the 1s and 5s seem to have the same emphasis</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>:<mark>The beat of the music is established by the percussion instruments, like drums. In general, don’t get distracted by lyrics.</mark></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER TIP</strong>: When practicing the beat, in addition to counting, it’s always good to get some body movement. While tapping your foot is okay, the most effective way to train your body to feel the beat is marching in place, doing a weight change on every beat of music.</p>
<p><strong>The Musician’s Measure</strong></p>
<p>The order matters in the pairing of measures. There’s the first half, the measure that begins the set of 8, counts 1 to 4; and there’s the last half, the measure that ends the set of 8, counts 5 to 8. To hear the correct order, listen to the melody, especially the feeling that the first measure begins something and that the last measure ends it. <strong>Also, listen for the relative difference in emphasis on the count 1 and the count 5. The point to note is that the count 1 has a stronger accent than the count 5, which will help you distinguish between the 1 and the 5</strong>. (Recall from earlier, I said that John, the stranger who first helped me count music, also punched out the 5s with his hand, but to a lesser degree.) The order can be subtle—often very, very subtle—but it’s there, even if you can’t hear it. Like sets of 8, the natural pairing of measures is just in the count of the music.</p>
<p><strong>Phrasing</strong>, the way dancers use the word, refers to the structure of the music. While phrasing is not for newbies, I believe beginners who have had a few months of classes should begin to develop an ear for it. I’ll be gentle.</p>
<p>One set of 8 is also called a <strong>mini-phrase</strong>, a term coined by dance educator Skippy Blair. To the ear, a set of 8 or mini-phrase usually has a theme: a short piece of melody or harmony with a beginning and an ending. The themes of mini-phrases have some integrity, but they don’t tell the whole story. A mini-phrase, like a sentence of words, only tells part of the story.</p>
<p>Music also has &ldquo;paragraphs.&rdquo; A paragraph in music is often called a phrase of music or, more descriptively, a major phrase. Just as a paragraph is a series of sentences, a major phrase is a series of mini-phrases. To the ear, the theme of a major phrase typically encompasses the smaller themes of the mini-phrases to create a larger theme, which tells the whole story—a complete musical thought. For example, a group of mini-phrases can come together to form a chorus or verse, which is thematically complete.</p>
<p>Unlike the mini-phrase, which is always eight beats (except waltz music), the number of beats in a major phrase will vary depending on the music. <strong>The most common major phrase is the 32-beat phrase, which is sometimes described as &ldquo;four sets of 8&rdquo; (4 × 8 = 32)</strong>, easy to hear in everything from jazz to Latin to rock ’n roll. Also common is the 48-beat phrase, which can be described as “six sets of 8” and is considered standard phrasing for blues music.</p>
<p>(Arcane technical info: Musicians call it 12-bar blues, a bar being slang for a four-beat measure: 12 × 4 = 48.) <strong>Phrasing is important, because at the intermediate level and above you will dance to the major phrases. You will choreograph step patterns in a way that acknowledges the major phrases, which will connect you to the music at a higher level. And women will love you for it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Downbeat and Upbeat</strong>, which is the natural pairing of beats that occurs in virtually all dance music.</p>
<p><strong>I believe the downbeat and upbeat are the secret to mastering the beat of the music. This is the pattern that got me to feel the beat, to bring it beyond my ears and into my body</strong>. When I hear it I know I’ve probably found the underlying beat (if I’m not sure I listen for sets of 8 to confirm that I’m on the beat). When I feel it, I believe it acts like an autopilot and keeps me on the beat.</p>
<p><mark>The first beat of the pair, the downbeat, is often, but not always, a heavier or deeper pitched beat, as if it were created by a bass drum or bass string instrument. The second beat, the upbeat, is often, but not always, a lighter or higher pitched beat, like the sound of a snare drum or cymbals. Thus, instead of two beats sounding like thump thump or tap tap, which is how I simplistically described the underlying beat here, two beats really sound more like thump tap. If you say it out loud, try emphasizing it like this: thum TAA!!!</mark></p>
<p><strong>When counting music the downbeats are the odd beats (counts 1, 3, 5 and 7) and the upbeats are the even beats (counts 2, 4, 6 and 8). The first step of almost every dance occurs on a downbeat.</strong></p>
<p>As with most elements of music, the downbeat and upbeat is subtle at first. It’ll be easiest to hear in songs with upbeats that are strongly accented (I give some song suggestions in a moment). The emphasis on the upbeat varies tremendously, so expect it to be obvious in some songs and elusive in others. I find that swing music and blues music generally have pronounced upbeats, which is why it’s easy for me to hear the beat in those genres. <strong>Salsa, in addition to the profusion of drumming, tends to emphasize the downbeat, which makes it a bit trickier</strong>. A lot of contemporary music, especially rap, has easy-to-hear upbeats.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE 2: DOWNBEATS AND UPBEATS</strong> Listen for the downbeat and upbeat structure in a variety of music. Especially listen for how the upbeat hits the ear differently than the downbeat. Choose songs with pronounced upbeats so it’ll be easy to hear—you have to hear it in the easy music before you’ll be able to hear it in the hard stuff. Do you feel the lifting feeling of the higher-pitched upbeat? Does the thump tap of the downbeat and upbeat create a rhythmic feeling that better defines the underlying beat?</p>

<hr>
<p>Bookmark !!!</p>
<hr>
<p>While there’s a long list of items that must come together to perform a new move, for the beginner, the two most important are <strong>rhythm pattern and direction</strong>.</p>
<p>I believe the <strong>rhythm pattern</strong>, which tells your feet when to go, when to make weight changes, is what beginners should focus on first.</p>
<p>when first learning a dance and, especially, for gaining an understanding of dance in general, the <strong>rhythm pattern (when to step) is more important than the direction (where to step) because it’s what connects you to the music</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s easiest to learn a new dance step if you break it into two-beat increments, which she calls dance rhythms (also known as rhythm units). So a dance rhythm is the number of weight changes in two beats of music (except waltz, see here and here). When you string dance rhythms together to create a step pattern, Skippy calls it a rhythm pattern, which is a combination of two or more dance rhythms.</p>
<p>Meditate for a moment on the concept of two-beat dance rhythms. You learned in Chapter 3, &ldquo;Downbeat and Upbeat,&rdquo; that dance beats come in pairs, a downbeat followed by an upbeat, so the notion of two-beat increments should already make some sense. Dance rhythms give structure to dance; just as words are the building blocks of sentences, two-beat dance rhythms are the building blocks of longer rhythm patterns.</p>
<p>There are only two dance rhythms of great importance to the beginning survival dancer, <strong>single rhythm and double rhythm; and there’s a third, triple rhythm</strong>, which rounds out the set. To identify these dance rhythms, simply ask, how many steps are taken in two beats of music? If one step is taken it’s called single rhythm. If two steps are taken it’s double rhythm. And, no surprise, three weight changes in two beats of music is triple rhythm. I love single, double and triple rhythm because they’re so darn logical. Now look at the same three patterns, broken into two-beat dance rhythms:</p>
<img src="/connect2naresh/books/ballroom-dancing/../rythm-patterns.png" width="100" height="300">
<p>For me, dance rhythm was the key that unlocked the door to dance. I believe the secret to understanding dance is this: almost every basic step pattern of a dance is some combination of <strong>single, double and triple rhythm</strong> (Triple rhythm, which involves a step between two beats of music). That’s right, almost any new step you learn in a beginners’ class, if broken into two-beat increments, will be a combination of these three simple dance rhythms.</p>

<h3 id="10-lead-and-follow">10. Lead and Follow</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dancing is just a conversation between two people . . . talk to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dance is a conversation between two people, and lead and follow is the language. Before I knew how to lead, my dancing annoyed many partners.</p>
<p>Part of my confusion was the illusion that I knew how to lead, which came from the assumption that I could learn to lead in class. While classes are a start, it’s hard to learn from classes alone. The real progress will come from practicing patterns on the social dance floor—trial and error—with a variety of followers. <strong>In particular, work with partners who don’t know your patterns and, every once in a while, with partners better than you (dancing up)</strong>.</p>
<p>So, in essence, <strong>just focus on doing your dance frame correctly</strong> and not on how you’re going to keep her in front of you or how you’re going to make her go left or right or forward or back. The positioning of your dance frame will indicate where you’d like her to go.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE 15: SWITCH ROLES</strong> Leaders should try following and followers should try leading. This is a great exercise, and learning the opposing part could dramatically improve your dancing. If you try following and feel the difference between a good lead and a bad lead, you can improve your leading. If your follower tries leading, she can improve her following. ’Nuff said.</p>
<p>Connecting with someone on the dance floor isn’t always logical. You’ll probably have the most fun dancing with women at your own level, and you’re probably going to dance the most with followers who follow you best. That doesn’t mean they’re the best followers. While there are rules for lead and follow, they are tempered by a subjective side: chemistry. <strong>Like conversation, for whatever reasons, you will connect with some on the dance floor and not with others. People are compatible in dance like they are compatible in conversation. If you converse well and dance well with someone, make note: you may have a connection that goes beyond dance</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="process-of-learning-from-books">Process of learning from books</h3>
<p>Before we start, let’s dispel a myth. When reading non-fiction, you don’t have to read one book at a time. Where did this idea even come from? Reading to learn should be goal-oriented, and it should be fuelled by energy and interest. So let’s unpack the process of learning from books.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-define-your-reading-radar-and-learning-needs">Step 1: Define your reading radar and learning needs</h4>
<p>The key to remembering the ideas and books that matter, is to deeply integrate the key ideas that are most useful to you. This is stating the obvious, but many <strong>people make the mistake of trying to read everything the same way and in the same depth</strong>. So by reducing your head clutter, you reduce the cognitive overwhelm that overloads and exhausts your mind.</p>
<p>So what does reading strategically mean? By being <strong>strategic</strong>, you will only study deeply the books (or chapters) that you will benefit from the most.</p>
<p>I am always scanning Amazon, blogs and other sources of book recommendations. I have a list of topic areas that are of interest to me, and I tell people that I know are knowledgable in these topics. Recommendations or discoveries that hit my radar get a quick scan of reviews on Amazon or Google, followed by a buy or leave decision. If you have Blinkist (a book summary app) then this is a great way to get a fast overview of a book, and short-cut this process. I keep a list of books on my radar, and I regularly review it.</p>
<p>If I have 3 or more books on my radar across all topics on my reading map, I will speed read them first (Google &ldquo;speed read&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll find resources and tips). On first pass I scan the contents pages, read the chapter summaries, and then flick quickly through every page scanning for diagrams, bullet points, and content headings for interesting clues. I will then selectively skim read parts of chapters, to evaluate quality and overlap with other books I&rsquo;ve scanned.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-define-clear-goals-for-reading-every-book">Step 2: Define clear goals for reading every book</h4>
<p>What are my reading goals? If I don&rsquo;t know, my interest is not peaked my brain is not primed to receive information in the right mode. So I will aimlessly wander into a book and potentially waste time.</p>
<p>When I moved to Spain from the UK, I had to learn the language fast, from scratch. I learned from my language teacher Rocio that there are two types of vocabulary: “passive” and “active.” Passive vocab are all the words that you understand when you hear them, but that you find hard to access when you want to express yourself. These words are on the tip of your tongue, but just beyond your recall. Active vocab is all the vocab you can use when try to express something, without thinking consciously or searching for words. With use, vocab becomes an automatic component of your repertoire for communicating and moves from passive to active.</p>
<p>Ideas and concepts are committed to memory in a similar way. So I read in one of three learning modes:</p>
<p><strong>Passive reading - to acquire general knowledge</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading for the pleasure of learning, and to stay up to speed and hope to stumble on great ideas and tools.</p>
<p>The goal for general knowledge reading is simply to enjoy the stimulation of new ideas, without the need to make copious notes or worry about forgetting things. I just accept that general knowledge reading enters into passive memory, and let go of worrying about recall. But if I sat down to recall the key topics and insights of the book, I might struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Active reading - to scan for solutions</strong></p>
<p>The brain will not let go of problems. They circulate round and round in your thoughts. That&rsquo;s why in GTD (Getting Things Done, the book by David Allen) he tells us for every to-do that we have, we should identify the first thing that needs to be actioned, and then commit when you will do it. Having done this, your brain will let go of worry, knowing that the task is scheduled. If you don&rsquo;t do this, your mind will be full of worry about all the things that you need to do.</p>
<p>Solution-seeking is easy because the brain wants to solve your problems. Relevant ideas and tools just jump out at you. The focus of reading is to first understand, and then capture solutions or ideas as they occur to you.</p>
<p><strong>Active reading - for deep integration</strong></p>
<p>This is reading to deeply integrate ideas that are valuable to your career know-how and life goals, and that add to your specialist expertise or professional insights. You want to commit this knowledge to long term “active” memory.</p>
<p>These are the books that your first scan suggested are worth deeply reading. Usually I find such books are harder reading material, either because their concepts and ideas are new or challenging to me, or because they are densely packed with research or tightly argued and complex. They demand more time to digest, and are worthy of the investment.</p>
<p>These books I will usually read at least twice, and hold for future reference. So my goal is to understand the ideas on the first reading, and capture content to return to. The second reading is to digest, evaluate and decide how to take action on the new knowledge. We want on the second reading to commit the key ideas to long term memory, using all the methods in Step 3.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-the-right-methods-to-connect-distill-and-chunk-ideas">Step 3: The right methods to connect, distill and chunk ideas</h4>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve identified books that we need to actively capture in longer term memory.</p>
<p>The heart of your reading strategy is your choice of methods for digesting and committing to memory what you learn. Note taking is the basic vehicle for most of us (unless you are Dyslexic like Richard Branson, or have a photographic memory like Elon Musk). I use mind maps extensively, plus I capture in the Evernote app all my bullet point summaries of key ideas or quotes and research references.</p>
<p><strong>I use mind maps to make connections, and mentally sort my ideas out</strong>. You can read more how I do this here: Tom Board&rsquo;s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.</p>
<p>I use Evernote for word-based note taking, in order to make my reading easily accessible in future, after my memory has faded. I can also structure captured ideas in folders for specific projects or further study. Evernote is fully searchable, even for PDFs and photographed hand-written notes. You can also tag notes, create folders, add web links, record audio, or use a digital pen on the iPad.</p>
<p>There are three main memory hacks that I use regularly, depending on the situation:</p>
<p><strong>Build a “mind palace”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is an ancient method, which I learned from one of Derren Brown&rsquo;s short audio books (Memory Tricks I think it was called). It goes like this. Think of a walk that you do often, and know intimately, or a house or other building that you similarly know inside-out. Then mentally associate places or rooms with what you want to remember, in the order you want to remember it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each subject is located in a place on your route, or a room in the building, and you use imagination to associate objects in your memory with the subjects you want to recall. The more outrageous the images, the better for memory recall. Run through mentally the rooms/walk until you can recall these images and subjects reliably. This method is used, I am told, by many TED speakers for presentations. It&rsquo;s useful if you need to recall information in a certain order, for a well-defined purpose. You can mentally &lsquo;clear&rsquo; your walk or palace once an event or situation has passed, and re-programme your mind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simplify and chunk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplification consists of distilling and prioritising what is important, and so de-cluttering the memory of the less important stuff to remember. You can use post-it notes, or just make lists, to sift and prioritise ideas. The ‘expert disease’ is to think that everything is important, and so discard nothing. This just overwhelms your short term memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chunking is a deeper method of ordering information so that you can hold more complex ideas in your short term memory, and think about them. Research shows that you have 3/4 “memory slots” in short term memory. If you try to hold more than 3/4 things in your head at once, you start to struggle. But chunking is a method of hacking this short term memory bottleneck, by grouping ideas. You can read more about chunking in the Quora post here: Tom Board&rsquo;s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Find helpful metaphors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our minds think in metaphors. Metaphors can be simple and generic like &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo; or broad like &ldquo;country&rdquo; or specific like &ldquo;the genome project&rdquo; or “waste basket” as in the Apple desktop or the physical bin in your office or study. You can associate metaphors with new ideas or concepts, to make them easier to recall.</li>
<li>If I say to myself that Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s book Tipping Point &ldquo;is like the moment I realise I&rsquo;ve eaten too much and my body diverts all its energy and resources to digestion, and my thinking goes fuzzy as my head feels lighter&rdquo; then I&rsquo;ve likened it to a physical body metaphor. If that metaphor is meaningful to me, it will be memorable.</li>
<li>Taking this further, if I want to convey ideas in a way that others will remember them, then I should choose familiar and universal metaphors to liken them too. Marketers use this trick all the time to introduce new products and services without triggering consumer&rsquo;s resistance to change and newness.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary, maintain a map of your reading territory consisting of the topics of interest and all the books on your radar. Speed read or scan them, or use a book summary service, to prioritise your reading. Then selectively read deeply, and throw all the memory tricks here at the key books so that you can access the knowledge you need, when you need it.</p>
<p>I would like to end on a simple idea that helps tremendously: be selective, and let go of guilt. Don&rsquo;t treat reading books like a challenge that must be overcome. Reframe your reading as meeting different goals, and take pleasure and time to read the books that really matter. You will have less mental clutter, more time, and enjoy the process far more. Best of luck.</p>

<p>The goal for general knowledge reading is simply to enjoy the stimulation of new ideas, without the need to make copious notes or worry about forgetting things. I just accept that general knowledge reading enters into passive memory, and let go of worrying about recall. But if I sat down to recall the key topics and insights of the book, I might struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Active reading - to scan for solutions</strong></p>
<p>The brain will not let go of problems. They circulate round and round in your thoughts. That&rsquo;s why in GTD (Getting Things Done, the book by David Allen) he tells us for every to-do that we have, we should identify the first thing that needs to be actioned, and then commit when you will do it. Having done this, your brain will let go of worry, knowing that the task is scheduled. If you don&rsquo;t do this, your mind will be full of worry about all the things that you need to do.</p>
<p>Solution-seeking is easy because the brain wants to solve your problems. Relevant ideas and tools just jump out at you. The focus of reading is to first understand, and then capture solutions or ideas as they occur to you.</p>
<p><strong>Active reading - for deep integration</strong></p>
<p>This is reading to deeply integrate ideas that are valuable to your career know-how and life goals, and that add to your specialist expertise or professional insights. You want to commit this knowledge to long term “active” memory.</p>
<p>These are the books that your first scan suggested are worth deeply reading. Usually I find such books are harder reading material, either because their concepts and ideas are new or challenging to me, or because they are densely packed with research or tightly argued and complex. They demand more time to digest, and are worthy of the investment.</p>
<p>These books I will usually read at least twice, and hold for future reference. So my goal is to understand the ideas on the first reading, and capture content to return to. The second reading is to digest, evaluate and decide how to take action on the new knowledge. We want on the second reading to commit the key ideas to long term memory, using all the methods in Step 3.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-the-right-methods-to-connect-distill-and-chunk-ideas">Step 3: The right methods to connect, distill and chunk ideas</h4>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve identified books that we need to actively capture in longer term memory.</p>
<p>The heart of your reading strategy is your choice of methods for digesting and committing to memory what you learn. Note taking is the basic vehicle for most of us (unless you are Dyslexic like Richard Branson, or have a photographic memory like Elon Musk). I use mind maps extensively, plus I capture in the Evernote app all my bullet point summaries of key ideas or quotes and research references.</p>
<p><strong>I use mind maps to make connections, and mentally sort my ideas out</strong>. You can read more how I do this here: Tom Board&rsquo;s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.</p>
<p>I use Evernote for word-based note taking, in order to make my reading easily accessible in future, after my memory has faded. I can also structure captured ideas in folders for specific projects or further study. Evernote is fully searchable, even for PDFs and photographed hand-written notes. You can also tag notes, create folders, add web links, record audio, or use a digital pen on the iPad.</p>
<p>There are three main memory hacks that I use regularly, depending on the situation:</p>
<p><strong>Build a “mind palace”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is an ancient method, which I learned from one of Derren Brown&rsquo;s short audio books (Memory Tricks I think it was called). It goes like this. Think of a walk that you do often, and know intimately, or a house or other building that you similarly know inside-out. Then mentally associate places or rooms with what you want to remember, in the order you want to remember it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each subject is located in a place on your route, or a room in the building, and you use imagination to associate objects in your memory with the subjects you want to recall. The more outrageous the images, the better for memory recall. Run through mentally the rooms/walk until you can recall these images and subjects reliably. This method is used, I am told, by many TED speakers for presentations. It&rsquo;s useful if you need to recall information in a certain order, for a well-defined purpose. You can mentally &lsquo;clear&rsquo; your walk or palace once an event or situation has passed, and re-programme your mind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simplify and chunk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplification consists of distilling and prioritising what is important, and so de-cluttering the memory of the less important stuff to remember. You can use post-it notes, or just make lists, to sift and prioritise ideas. The ‘expert disease’ is to think that everything is important, and so discard nothing. This just overwhelms your short term memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chunking is a deeper method of ordering information so that you can hold more complex ideas in your short term memory, and think about them. Research shows that you have 3/4 “memory slots” in short term memory. If you try to hold more than 3/4 things in your head at once, you start to struggle. But chunking is a method of hacking this short term memory bottleneck, by grouping ideas. You can read more about chunking in the Quora post here: Tom Board&rsquo;s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Find helpful metaphors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our minds think in metaphors. Metaphors can be simple and generic like &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo; or broad like &ldquo;country&rdquo; or specific like &ldquo;the genome project&rdquo; or “waste basket” as in the Apple desktop or the physical bin in your office or study. You can associate metaphors with new ideas or concepts, to make them easier to recall.</li>
<li>If I say to myself that Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s book Tipping Point &ldquo;is like the moment I realise I&rsquo;ve eaten too much and my body diverts all its energy and resources to digestion, and my thinking goes fuzzy as my head feels lighter&rdquo; then I&rsquo;ve likened it to a physical body metaphor. If that metaphor is meaningful to me, it will be memorable.</li>
<li>Taking this further, if I want to convey ideas in a way that others will remember them, then I should choose familiar and universal metaphors to liken them too. Marketers use this trick all the time to introduce new products and services without triggering consumer&rsquo;s resistance to change and newness.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary, maintain a map of your reading territory consisting of the topics of interest and all the books on your radar. Speed read or scan them, or use a book summary service, to prioritise your reading. Then selectively read deeply, and throw all the memory tricks here at the key books so that you can access the knowledge you need, when you need it.</p>
<p>I would like to end on a simple idea that helps tremendously: be selective, and let go of guilt. Don&rsquo;t treat reading books like a challenge that must be overcome. Reframe your reading as meeting different goals, and take pleasure and time to read the books that really matter. You will have less mental clutter, more time, and enjoy the process far more. Best of luck.</p>

<h1>Digital Age - Nitin Seth</h1>
<p>The project presented us an opportunity to create a new product that cut across three different divisions and technology stacks of the bank. This was a <strong>technology integration challenge</strong>, but even more so a challenge of <strong>coordination across different divisions</strong>. I think the most important action we took was to structure this new e-broking business as a separate organization to ensure it was not caught in the <strong>legacy organizational issues</strong>. I find it remarkable that more than twenty years later, when I look at large enterprises setting up new digital businesses, <strong>the key issues are still organizational</strong> – should a new capability be established as a new organization or part of the existing organization?</p>
<p>We wound up ActiveKarma after two years, but my first foray into entrepreneurship taught me many invaluable lessons – such as the importance of <strong>anchoring the business in a solid customer proposition, going slow to go far, managing cash flows</strong>, and so on. I was reflecting on how this ‘dotcom bubble’ that many of us lived through has been such an important milestone in the evolution of the digital age we see today and still holds many important lessons for enterprises and entrepreneurs. It showed the disruptive growth opportunity of Internet-based businesses; <strong>it also showed how dangerous it can be when business models and enterprise valuations are not anchored in cash flows but on speculation</strong>. The ‘dotcom bubble’ burst in a couple of years and it took Nasdaq fifteen years to regain its dotcom peak.</p>
<p>There is so much to talk about the McKC story and the learnings from it that it would merit a separate book. But at this stage, the main learning I want to highlight is the amazing potential of the global delivery model. McKC was created to drive cost efficiencies and increase productivity. However, when we added high-quality talent to the mix and gave them an entrepreneurial culture to flourish in, the impact was explosive. We brought talent at McKC with significantly higher capabilities than what we traditionally had in the research function at McKinsey. <strong>It took some time for this talent to build domain understanding and grown in maturity, but when that happened it changed the scope of McKC dramatically. It evolved into an innovation centre and allowed McKinsey to experiment with and build new capabilities, which it could not have otherwise</strong>. This ability to increase innovation capacity leveraging the <strong>global delivery model</strong> is a great opportunity for enterprises in the digital age.</p>

<h1>Relentless Tim Grover</h1>
<h3 id="dont-think">Don&rsquo;t Think</h3>
<p>He flew two thousand miles to hear these two words: <strong>Don’t think</strong>.</p>
<p>To be the best, whether in sports or business or any other aspect of life, it’s never enough to just get to the top; you have to stay there, and then you have to climb higher, because there’s always someone right behind you trying to catch up. Most people are willing to settle for &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; But if you want to be unstoppable, those words mean nothing to you. Being the best means engineering your life so you never stop until you get what you want, and then you keep going until you get what’s next. And then you go for even more. Relentless.</p>
<p>This isn’t about motivation. If you’re reading this book, you’re already motivated. <strong>Now you have to turn that into action and results</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Believe this: Everything you need to be great is already inside you. All your ambitions and secrets, your darkest dreams. they’re waiting for you to just let go.</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to stop listening to what everyone else says about you, telling you what to do, how to act, how you should feel. Let them judge you by your results, and nothing else; it’s none of their business how you get where you’re going. If you’re relentless, there is no halfway, no could or should or maybe. Don’t tell me the glass is half-full or half-empty; you either have something in that glass or you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Decide. Commit. Act. Succeed. Repeat.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t care how good you think you are, or how great others think you are—you can improve, and you will. Being relentless means demanding more of yourself than anyone else could ever demand of you, knowing that every time you stop, you can still do more. You must do more. The minute your mind thinks, &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; your instincts say, &ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I’m going to show you how to stop thinking about how you’re going to think, and do something instead.</p>
<p>Can you learn from their work ethic and relentless drive and uncompromising focus on their goals? Absolutely. Can you improve your chances of success by learning about others who succeeded, and those who didn’t? Of course.</p>
<p>If you want to be truly successful, you can’t be content with &ldquo;pretty good.&rdquo; <strong>You need to find an extra gear</strong>.</p>
<p>I understand how they think, how they learn, how they succeed and fail. what drives them to be relentless. It’s not all pretty, but it’s all true. Everything I’ve learned from them, everything I teach them, I’m sharing with you here. <strong>It’s not science. It’s raw animal instinct</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s the key: <strong>I’m not going to tell you how to change. People don’t change. I want you to trust who you already are, and get to that Zone where you can shut out all the noise, all the negativity and fear and distractions and lies, and achieve whatever you want, in whatever you do</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re aiming to be the best at what you do, you can’t worry about whether your actions will upset other people, or what they’ll think of you. We’re taking all the emotion out of this, and doing whatever it takes to get to where you want to be. Selfish? Probably. Egocentric? Definitely. If that’s a problem for you, read the book and see if you feel differently afterward.</strong></p>
<p>But in this case, the player knew he needed space, and he was willing to risk the consequences if he got caught leaving the team. He knew it was on him to get back in the Zone, that deeply personal space where you can quiet your mind until you have no thoughts, it’s just you and your instincts, focused and unemotional. <strong>Where you feel no external pressure, just the internal pressure to prove yourself, over and over, because you want it for yourself, not anyone else</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget about losing,&rdquo; I tell him, looking for that &ldquo;click&rdquo; behind the eyes when you know the guy gets it. &ldquo;Forget about trying, because if you’re just trying, then losing is still an option. You want to be the best? Then you ignore the pain and the exhaustion and the pressure to please everyone else. You don’t let your enemies take your balls, you don’t let them set up shop in your head. When all hell breaks loose on the outside, you barely notice; you’re calm on the inside because you’re ready, prepared, and the best at what you do. You don’t tell anyone how you’re going to handle the situation, you just handle it. Everyone else is panicking and choking, and you say, ‘No problem.’ You step on the other guy’s throat, and you finish the fight.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, everything is impossible until someone does it</strong>. Michael had worked with a trainer once, injured his back during the workout, and was hesitant about trying again. Yet he also instinctively knew it wasn’t enough to have the greatest basketball skills in the history of the game. If he wanted to be more than a legend, if he was truly going to become an icon, <strong>he would also need to take his body to the ultimate level</strong>, and he was willing to do whatever was necessary to make that happen. So he told John and Mark to find someone who understood exactly what he needed.</p>
<p><strong>We learned from each other. We never saw obstacles or problems, we only saw situations in need of solutions. And since there had never been a player like Michael Jordan, we encountered a lot of situations without known solutions. We learned, we made mistakes, we learned from our mistakes. We kept learning.</strong></p>
<p>Michael wasn’t the best because he could fly through the air and make impossible shots; he was the best because he was relentless about winning, relentless in his belief that there’s no such thing as &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; No matter how many times he won, no matter how great he became, he always wanted more, and he was always willing to do whatever it took—and then some—to get it.</p>
<p>Relentless is about never being satisfied, always driving to be the best, and then getting even better. It’s about finding the gear that gets you to the next level. even when the next level doesn’t yet exist. It’s about facing your fears, getting rid of the poisons that guarantee you will fail. <strong>Being feared and respected for your mental strength and toughness</strong>, not just your physical abilities.</p>

<h3 id="steal-like-an-artist">Steal Like An Artist</h3>
<p>First, you figure out what’s worth stealing, then you move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><mark>There’s an economic theory out there that if you take the incomes of your five closest friends and average them, the resulting number will be pretty close to your own income.</mark></p>
<p><strong>You’re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.</strong></p>
<p>Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch</strong>.</p>
<p>The great thing about dead or remote masters is that they can’t refuse you as an apprentice. You can learn whatever you want from them. They left their lesson plans in their work.</p>
<p><strong>School is one thing. Education is another. The two don’t always overlap. Whether you’re in school or not, it’s always your job to get yourself an education</strong>.</p>
<p>You have to be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. <strong>Go deeper than anybody else—that’s how you’ll get ahead</strong>.</p>
<p>Google everything. I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don’t ask a question before you Google it. You’ll either find the answer or you’ll come up with a better question.</p>
<p><mark>Always be reading. Go to the library. <strong>There’s magic in being surrounded by books</strong>. Get lost in the stacks. Read bibliographies. It’s not the book you start with, it’s the book that book leads you to.</mark></p>
<p>Collect books, even if you don’t plan on reading them right away. Filmmaker John Waters has said, &ldquo;Nothing is more important than an unread library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I went to school or not, I would always study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carry a notebook and a pen with you wherever you go. Get used to pulling it out and jotting down your thoughts and observations. Copy your favourite passages out of books. Record overheard conversations. Doodle when you’re on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h3 id="dont-wait-until-you-know-who-you-are-to-get-started">Don’t Wait Until You Know Who You Are to Get Started</h3>
<p><mark><strong>If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started &ldquo;being creative,&rdquo; well, I’d still be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are.</strong></mark></p>
<p>Guess what: None of us do. Ask anybody doing truly creative work, and they’ll tell you the truth: They don’t know where the good stuff comes from. They just show up to do their thing. Every day.</p>
<p>Copying is about reverse-engineering. It’s like a mechanic taking apart a car to see how it works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First, you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you have to figure out what to copy.</p>
<p><strong>If you copy from one author, it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it’s research</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What to copy is a little bit trickier. Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to take from us. We want you, at first, to steal from us, because you can’t steal. You will take what we give you and you will put it in your own voice and that’s how you will find your voice. And that’s how you begin. And then one day someone will steal from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>So: Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short. What&rsquo;s in there that makes you different? That&rsquo;s what you should amplify and transform into your own work.</p>
<h3 id="write-the-book-you-want-to-read">Write the Book You Want to Read</h3>
<p>&ldquo;My interest in making music has been to create something that does not exist that I would like to listen to. I wanted to hear music that had not yet happened, by putting together things that suggested a new thing which did not yet exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The best advice is not to write what you know, it’s to write what you like.</strong></p>
<p>When we love a piece of work, we&rsquo;re desperate for more. We crave sequels. Why not channel that desire into something productive?</p>
<p><mark><strong>The manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done.</strong></mark></p>
<h3 id="use-your-hands">Use Your Hands</h3>
<p>&ldquo;We don’t know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops.&rdquo; - John Cleese</p>
<p>The computer brings out the uptight perfectionist in us—we start editing ideas before we have them. The cartoonist Tom Gauld says he stays away from the computer until he’s done most of the thinking for his strips, because once the computer is involved, &ldquo;things are on an inevitable path to being finished. Whereas in my sketchbook the possibilities are endless.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Try it: If you have the space, set up two workstations, one analog and one digital. For your analog station, keep out anything electronic. Take $10, go to the school supply aisle of your local store, and pick up some paper, pens, and sticky notes. When you get back to your analog station, pretend it&rsquo;s craft time. Scribble on paper, cut it up, and tape the pieces back together. Stand up while you’re working. Pin things on the walls and look for patterns. Spread things around your space and sort through them</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you start getting your ideas, then you can move over to your digital station and use the computer to help you execute and publish them. When you start to lose steam, head back to the analog station and play.</p>
<h3 id="side-projects-and-hobbies-are-important">Side Projects and Hobbies are Important</h3>
<p><mark><strong>Take time to be bored. One time I heard a co-worker say, &ldquo;When I get busy, I get stupid.&rdquo; Ain’t that the truth. Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. I get some of my best ideas when I&rsquo;m bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners. I love ironing my shirts—it’s so boring, I almost always get good ideas. If you’re out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall for as long as you can. As the artist Maira Kalman says, &ldquo;Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind.&rdquo; Take time to mess around. Get lost. Wander. You never know where it’s going to lead you.</strong></mark></p>
<p>&ldquo;You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tomlinson suggests that if you love different things, you just keep spending time with them. &ldquo;Let them talk to each other. Something will begin to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Music feeds into their work.</p>
<p><mark><strong>A hobby is something that gives but doesn&rsquo;t take. While my art is for the world to see, music is only for me and my friends. We get together every Sunday and make noise for a couple of hours. No pressure, no plans. It&rsquo;s regenerative. It&rsquo;s like church.</strong></mark></p>
<p>Don’t throw any of yourself away. Don&rsquo;t worry about a grand scheme or unified vision for your work. Don&rsquo;t worry about unity—what unifies your work is the fact that you made it. One day, you&rsquo;ll look back and it will all make sense.</p>
<h3 id="the-secret-do-good-work-and-share-it-with-people">The Secret: Do Good work and Share it with People</h3>
<p>This is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you&rsquo;re doing really good work. There&rsquo;s no pressure when you&rsquo;re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you&rsquo;re unknown, there&rsquo;s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge pay check on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on. You&rsquo;ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money.</p>
<p>Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.</p>
<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t put yourself online only because you have something to say—you can put yourself online to find something to say. The Internet can be more than just a resting place to publish your finished ideas—it can also be an incubator for ideas that aren&rsquo;t fully formed, a birthing center for developing work that you haven&rsquo;t started yet.</strong></p>
<h3 id="geography-is-no-longer-out-master">Geography is no longer out master</h3>
<p>Surround yourself with books and objects that you love. Tape things up on the wall. Create your own world.</p>
<p>Always carry a book, a pen, and a notepad, and I always enjoy my solitude and temporary captivity.</p>
<p><mark><strong>Brain gets too comfortable in your everyday surroundings. You need to make it uncomfortable. You need to spend some time in another land, among people that do things differently than you. Travel makes the world look new, and when the world looks new, our brains work harder.</strong></mark></p>
<p><mark><strong>It helps to live around interesting people, and not necessarily people who do what you do. I feel a little incestuous when I hang out with only writers and artists, so I enjoy the many filmmakers, musicians, and tech geeks who live in Austin. Oh, and food. The food should be good. You have to find a place that feeds you—creatively, socially, spiritually, and literally</strong>.</mark></p>
<h3 id="be-nice">Be Nice</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Find the most talented person in the room, and if it’s not you, go stand next to him. Hang out with him. Try to be helpful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you ever find that you’re the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room.</p>
<p>So go on, get angry. But keep your mouth shut and go do your work. &ldquo;<strong>Complain about the way other people make software by making software.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I recommend public fan letters. The Internet is really good for this. Write a blog post about someone’s work that you admire and link to their site. Make something and dedicate it to your hero. Answer a question they’ve asked, solve a problem for them, or improve on their work and share it online.</p>
<p>The trouble with creative work: Sometimes by the time people catch on to what’s valuable about what you do, you’re either a) bored to death with it, or b) dead. You can’t go looking for validation from external sources. Once you put your work into the world, you have no control over the way people will react to it.</p>
<p><strong>Not everybody will get it</strong>. People will misinterpret you and what you do. They might even call you names. So get comfortable with being misunderstood, disparaged, or ignored—the trick is to be too busy doing your work to care.</p>
<p>Life is a lonely business, often filled with discouragement and rejection. Yes, validation is for parking, but it&rsquo;s still a tremendous boost when people say nice things about our work.</p>
<p><mark><strong>Instead of keeping a rejection file, keep a praise file. Use it sparingly—don&rsquo;t get lost in past glory—but keep it around for when you need the lift.</strong></mark></p>
<h3 id="be-boring">Be Boring</h3>
<p><mark><strong>&ldquo;It’s better to burn out than to fade away.&rdquo;</strong></mark></p>
<p>The truth is that even if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to make a living off doing what you truly love, it will probably take you a while to get to that point. Until then, you&rsquo;ll need a day job. A day job gives you money, a connection to the world, and a routine. Freedom from financial stress also means freedom in your art.</p>
<p>The trick is to find a day job that pays decently, doesn&rsquo;t make you want to vomit, and leaves you with enough energy to make things in your spare time. Good day jobs aren&rsquo;t necessarily easy to find, but they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>The artist Saul Steinberg said, &ldquo;What we respond to in any work of art is the artist&rsquo;s struggle against his or her limitations.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s often what an artist chooses to leave out that makes the art interesting. What isn&rsquo;t shown versus what is. It&rsquo;s the same for people: <mark><strong>What makes us interesting isn&rsquo;t just what we&rsquo;ve experienced, but also what we haven&rsquo;t experienced. The same is true when you do your work: You must embrace your limitations and keep moving. In the end, creativity isn&rsquo;t just the things we choose to put in, it&rsquo;s the things we choose to leave out. Choose wisely</strong></mark>. And have fun.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the interesting fact is that almost all billionaires in the world have created their fortune through the stock market, either directly or indirectly. &ldquo;Directly&rdquo; refers to the direct stock investing and &ldquo;Indirectly&rdquo; refers to listing their companies on the stock market. One of the world’s richest persons, Warren Buffet created his fortune from direct stock investing while other well-known billionaires like Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook), Larry Page (founder of Google) made their fortune by listing their companies on stock market. Even in India, you will find many billionaire investors (e.g. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala) who created their entire wealth from direct stock investing.</p>
<p>As per statistics, 80% retail investors suffer overall loss from equity investment. Now, the most important point that arises is why maximum retail investors (small investors) lose their hard earned money in this market while a group of people are creating their fortune?</p>

<p>This is one of the most important reasons of losing money in trading. The odds are against you. The system is designed in such a manner that it is next to impossible to make money consistently. Brokers, stock exchange and government – only they can earn consistently from trading. Every time you trade you need to pay all of them. They don’t bother whether you are gaining or losing. I hope now the reason is clear why your broker, media and several websites always encourage you to trade frequently. They all want to earn money for themselves, not for you. Do you still want to make them richer?</p>
<p><strong>The reality is that during the bear market, quality stocks are available at a cheap rate, and thus it is one of the best times to invest</strong>. Moreover, if you select quality stocks then overall market movement rarely matters. High-quality businesses are always poised to do well in any market situation. Don’t get carried away by any analysts.</p>
<p><strong>Overconfidence</strong></p>
<p>Suppose, you started investing during a bull market and successfully earned 45% return at the end of first year. All your purchased stocks were performing well. In such a situation, you may start thinking that you have mastered the subject very well. As the market moves up, so moves your confidence level, you keep on increasing your investment amount. You are now too aggressive. Suddenly market crashes and there comes a prolonged bear market. <strong>It is the bear market that separates intelligent investors from others</strong>. Don’t get lured and invest aggressively if you find your portfolio giving above average return during a bull market. The stock market doesn’t move linearly. It’s quite easy to make money during the bull run but difficult during the bear period. To become a successful investor, you need to learn the art of making money across all market situations.</p>
<p><strong>The only way to earn consistently from the stock market is to invest in the great business and hold them for the appropriate period</strong>. Check the details of any billionaire equity investor across the world. You will find one thing common to them. They simply chose high-quality stocks and remained invested over the long run. Warren Buffett, world’s most successful investor, and one of the world’s richest persons, created his fortune from 22% annualized return over more than 50 years from equity investing. He didn’t jump into intraday or Futures and Options. Just think, 22% annualized return consistently over 50 years creates a billionaire, and these trading tips providers claim 50%+ monthly return! What do you say?</p>
<p>Forget about intraday; short term trading, Futures &amp; Options. Remember, there is no shortcut to earning quickly. Every quick-money makings tricks are eventually money-losing tricks. Investing in high-quality stocks and holding them for the correct period is the only way to create wealth. This statement is easier to say than to execute. Here come the obvious questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by &ldquo;high-quality stocks&rdquo;?</li>
<li>How to select high-quality stocks?</li>
<li>How to separate quality business from others?</li>
<li>What is the correct holding period?</li>
<li>When to buy and when to sell a stock?</li>
<li>How to construct my portfolio?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Point to Remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The only way to accumulate wealth from the stock market is to invest in high-quality business (stock) and hold the same for the long run.</li>
<li>You can’t make money consistently via any form of short term trading. (Intraday, Futures &amp; Options, margin trade, etc.)</li>
<li>Your broker, stock exchange, and government can only become rich from short-term trading.</li>
<li>Don’t get tempted by fancy stories in the stock market.</li>
<li>Don’t invest in stocks with borrowed money. It carries a significant amount of risk.</li>

<p>For the person in the highest tax bracket, it is as high as 30.9%! Even if you are in the lowest tax bracket, then you need to shell out around 10% tax on the interest income from bank’s fixed deposit.</p>
<p>Well, many tax-efficient debt investment options are there which offers steady return and also serve the purpose of diversification. The problem is many of us are not aware at all.</p>
<p>Irrespective of educational background and specialization, anyone can learn the tactics of successful investing. <strong>It’s simple but not easy. &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; in the sense that it doesn’t require high intellectual. &ldquo;Not easy&rdquo; because it requires years of practice, discipline, dedication and willingness to learn.</strong></p>
<p>Historically it is proved that only stock market and real estate investment can offer an above-inflation return in the long run.</p>
<p>Surprisingly in the stock market, investors are ready to trade frequently. A mere 10% rise in stock price tempts to book profit while 10% drop in stock price creates panic. The more you trade the chances of losing money will widen. If you can consider yourself as a partial owner of the business, then you can restrict yourself from frequent trading.</p>
<p><mark style="background: #00ced1!important">More than &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; you need to learn &ldquo;what NOT to do&rdquo;.</mark></p>
<p><strong>Points to remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Equity investing is not risky rather staying away from equity investment is risky.</li>
<li>After adjusting tax and inflation, bank’s fixed deposit yield a negative return.</li>
<li>Equity investment is the most convenient option for long-term wealth creation.</li>
<li>Investment in stocks is just like driving a car. If you can master the subject, it becomes easier.</li>
<li>Lack of knowledge is the primary reason for widespread misconception and lowest retail participants in the stock market.</li>
<li>A stock is nothing but a partial ownership in the business. Treat yourself as an owner of the business.</li>
<li>Before considering equity investment, invest in knowledge. Investment in knowledge pays the best interest.</li>

<p>Points to remember and Actionable items.</p>

<p>Now, here is the big question - if we should put the least priority on profit and sales growth numbers then what will be our priority? The answer is Return on Equity (ROE). As a shareholder, you need to follow how promoters are utilising shareholder’s money. Are they creating value for their shareholders or themselves? Let’s have a look at the details of Return on Equity.</p>
<p>However, Return on Equity (ROE) offers an approximate view. Increasing ROE over the last 5-10 years with improved operating margin and cash flow is a signal of sustaining economic moat.</p>
<p>Debt to equity ratio is the measure of a company&rsquo;s financial leverage calculated by dividing its total liabilities by stockholders&rsquo; equity. It indicates what proportion of equity and debt the company is using to finance its assets. So, debt to equity ratio = Total Liabilities/Equity.</p>
<p>Before investing in any stock, have a look on its debt to equity ratio. The ratio is available on various financial websites. You need to check the ratio for at least last three years. Debt to equity ratio of greater than 1 (and increasing continuously) carries red signal. It emphasises that the company may face difficulties to serve debt in the near future. Don’t invest in companies where the ratio is above 1 and increasing rapidly over the last few years. Investing in high debt companies carries inherent risk. (Also note, debt to equity ratio is not relevant for banking and NBFC companies. There are different set of ratios for analysing banking and NBFC companies). In the following chart let’s have a look at the companies having high debt to equity ratio and their stock price performance.</p>
<p>After getting any stock idea, just figure out its Return on Equity (ROE) and Debt to Equity ratio. Profit and sales growth analysis will come later on. If you find the stock having ROE of less than 12% (and decreasing) and debt to equity ratio of more than 1 (and increasing), then discard it.</p>
<p><strong>Points To Remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Companies can alter profit and sales figures. So, the priority should not be on the profit and sales growth numbers.</li>
<li>There are plenty of stock recommendations are available here and there. Before following any of them just conduct a basic test of your own.</li>
<li>Return on Equity (ROE) is the single most important parameter to analyse a stock. Considering all other parameters remain same, higher the ROE better is the investment option.</li>
<li>Investing in companies with wide economic moat during their early stage can generate a multibagger return.</li>
<li>Companies can create economic moat by offering better products/service or utilising their brand strength or locking customers from competitors.</li>
<li>Increasing ROE over the last 5-10 years with improved operating margin and cash flow is a prominent signal of economic moat.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended to avoid high debt companies. Avoid stocks having debt to equity ratio more than 1 (increasing) and ROE less than 12% (decreasing over the last few years).</li>
<li>Higher debt translates into higher interest outgo that eventually minimises profits and erodes shareholders value.</li>

<h3 id="4-how-to-evaluate-management">4. How to Evaluate Management</h3>
<p>We all know that good management can turn around a poor business while poor management can ruin the quality business.</p>
<p>I am going to present the simplest way for getting an idea about the management credibility. From the comfort of your home, you can evaluate those simple and easy-to-understand methods! Only three inputs are required for our purpose</p>
<ul>
<li>Shareholding Pattern</li>
<li>Dividend History and Tax Rate</li>
<li>Return on Equity (ROE)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Promoters and Promoter Group</strong></p>
<p>Promoters are those who incorporated the company. They can be either domestic or foreign entity (or group of individuals). Relatives of promoters owning shares also come under promoter group.</p>
<p><strong>Public Group</strong></p>
<p>Shareholders other than promoters constitute Public shareholding pattern. FIIs, DIIs, banks, money managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, individuals, etc. come under this group.</p>
<p>Remember, the shareholding pattern in isolation is not sufficient enough for taking any investment decision.</p>
<p><strong>Promoters increasing their stake</strong></p>
<p>It feels like; you are not the lone buyer, owners of the company are also buying just like you from the open market. So, just go ahead.</p>
<p>For the retail investor, it is not mandatory to dig dipper on “Why Promoters are increasing their stake?” because whatever be the reason the result would be positive (mostly).</p>
<p>Increasing promoter holdings either results in price appreciation or downside protection of the stock. If the promoters raise their stake, it is comprehended that they has high confidence in the business.</p>
<p><strong>Promoters decreasing their stake</strong></p>
<p>Promoters decreasing their stake can have either positive or negative effect on the stock price. Forced selling by promoters might cause major crash in the stock price. I will discuss the &ldquo;forced selling&rdquo; in the latter part of this chapter. Prior to that let’s have a look from different angle</p>
<p>Try to avoid companies where promoters have small shareholdings or they are consistently reducing their stake by a huge percentage.</p>
<p>However, reducing promoters&rsquo; stake is always not bad. The reason behind this is that even promoters have the right to enjoy the profit of their company. It is nothing bad in it if they sell some part of their stake. Moreover, they are in the business for earning money, and they have been working for it since 10-15-20 or even 50 years!!! For an example, promoters of Page Industries were reducing their stake during 2012-2015; still the stock price was appreciated by more than 200% during the same time. One of my investment, Atul Auto is another example. During November, 2013 promoters reduced their stake. Initially, I was worried; however detailed analysis revealed that one of the promoters sold his partial holding to an institutional investor. Initial entry of big institutional investor is the first sign of good times. I had increased my stake based on the entry of the institutional investor. The result paid off. Within the next one year, the stock generated 150%+ return!</p>
<p>So, you need to dig deeper whenever promoters are reducing their stake. It may have a negative or positive effect. Don’t take the decision based on the numbers. You need to dig deeper for the real picture behind numbers.</p>
<p><strong>FII</strong></p>
<p>Higher FIIs stake is interpreted as positive, and a lower FII stake means low confidence of FIIs in the company. If FIIs increase their stake, it is considered positive as they invest funds only when they are optimistic and confident about the future of the company.</p>
<p>Just like promoters, If FIIs sell their shares then it does not mean that the company is fundamentally weak. Their selling may be due to the economic or political changes, legal problems in their home country or it’s just that they want to enjoy their profit. Whatever be the reason, if they offload massive quantities then a huge fall in stock price is witnessed.</p>
<p><strong>Key of multibagger return</strong></p>
<p><mark>The key to successful investing lies in identifying a stock that can become favourite among FIIs in the near future. In such case stock price multiplied by 3-4 times or more within 1-2 years. For example, I had invested in Ajanta Pharma during December 2012. Back then, the stock was not tracked by brokerage house. The company didn’t get enough attention from institutional investors. Slowly, with improved fundamentals, strong financial numbers and better future outlook, the company attracted institutional investors. Since December 2012 to March 2014 FII increased their stake by 3.81%, resulting in an increase of around 184% in FII holdings. No, wonder, since then, stock price generated around 500%+ return (more than six times return) within two years. So, you can create wonder if you can invest in stock before it attracts investment from FIIs (or institutional investors).</mark></p>
<p><strong>Effects of Individual Investors</strong></p>
<p>Individuals have the least amount of knowledge and are mostly carried with emotions. On the other side, institutional investors are the most knowledgeable (after the promoters). So, you should be cautious if increasing individual shareholdings is resulted due to a significant decrease in institutional holdings.</p>
<p><strong>Pledging of Shares</strong></p>
<p>Like we take loans to fulfil our desire or necessity by mortgaging properties. Similarly, promoters also raise funds by keeping their shares as collateral. High pledging of shares is always dangerous for retail investors. It can cause a sudden crash in stock price. Let’s have a look at various aspects of pledging.</p>
<p>If any company has a pledging percentage up to 2%-8%, then it can be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Point to Remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is almost impossible for small investors to visist the management/factory before investing in the stock. There are alternatives for management analysis that can be done from the comfort of your home.</li>
<li>Promoters increasing their stake from the open market purchase have very positive impact in the stock price.</li>
<li>Promoters can decrease their stake for various reasons. It can have either postivie or negative impact on stock price.</li>
<li>Stay away from companies where promoters plege more than 30% of their holdings (and increasing)</li>
<li>Significant increase in institutional holdings result in sharp stock price apprecication</li>
<li>If tax rate is not matching with profit numbers, then you need to dig deeper.</li>

<p><strong>17.Dec.2022</strong>: Completion Summary</p>
<p>So no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the great defeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. <strong>Countless people have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you , and yet they’re wealthier and more fulfilled</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>10.Jan.2023</strong>: Functional/Domain Expert</p>
<p><strong>This tracking exercise changed my awareness</strong>. As per tracking statistics, I do not spend any time here, and I want to get good at this one. What an Irony. Actually entering such data is very time consuming.</p>
<p>Even though you saved for many more years and invested much more cash, you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could have had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate and neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. <strong>Don’t wait another day to start</strong> the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>19.Jan.2023</strong></p>
<p>No matter what has happened to you, <strong>take complete responsibility</strong> for it — good or bad, victory or defeat</p>

<p>We’ve lost sight of the simple but profound fundamentals of what it takes to be successful.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Power of Compounding !!!</li>
<li>Whether you like it or not, the next 5 years, 10 years is coming. Either I can choose to regret past and be awed (OMG, it takes so much time to achieve something substantial in life),  or get the best out of next 5 year, 10 years that is coming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need new information — <strong>you need a new plan of action</strong> . It is time to create new behaviors and habits oriented away from sabotage and toward success . It’s that simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to build a System (Dance, <strong>Job Change, Growth</strong> etc.).</li>
<li>This will be ongoing process. Keep refining it.</li>
<li>I need to build a System for using Jonathan Levi in my Daily life. It is the most important course that I have done in 2022.</li>

<p>It doesn’t matter how smart you are or aren’t , <em>you need to <strong>make up in hard work</strong> what you lack in experience , skill , intelligence , or innate ability</em> .

<h3 id="chapter-2-choices">Chapter 2: Choices</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s the little things in life that will bite you .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have not been any more lucky or unlucky than anyone else . <strong>The difference is when luck came my way, I took advantage of it</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ( Complete ) Formula for Getting Lucky : Preparation (personal growth) + Attitude (belief / mindset) + Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) + Action (doing something about it) = Luck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attitude : This is where luck evades most people , and where Sir Richard is spot - on with his belief that luck is all around us. It’s simply a matter of seeing situations , conversations, and circumstances as fortuitous . <strong>You cannot see what you don’t look for, and you cannot look for what you don’t believe in</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spot on from DEFM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>So no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the great defeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. <strong>Countless people have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you , and yet they’re wealthier and more fulfilled</strong>. Luck is an equal - opportunity distributor . Lady luck shines on all , but rather than having your umbrella overhead , you’ve got to have your face to the sky  When it comes down to it, it’s all you, baby. There’s no other way around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When I learned of the wrongdoings, I chose not to lose any more time fighting it. Instead, I licked my wounds, learned my lesson, and moved on</strong>. In hindsight, I’d make the same choice to pick up and move on again today .</p>
<ul>
<li>Time for better job opportunities.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t regret past. What is gone is gone. Look forward in future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I now challenge you to do the same. <strong>No matter what has happened to you, take complete responsibility for it — good or bad, victory or defeat</strong>. Own it. My mentor Jim Rohn said, <strong>&ldquo;The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This tracking exercise changed my awareness</strong> of how I related to my money. It worked so well, in fact, that I’ve used it many times to change other behaviors. Tracking is my go - to transformation model for everything that ails me. Over the years I’ve tracked what I eat and drink, how much I exercise, how much time I spend improving a skill, my number of sales calls, even the improvement of my relationships with family, friends, or my spouse. The results have been no less profound than my money - tracking wake - up call .</p>
<ul>
<li>Trackable - Gym Workout, Streaks</li>
<li>Non-Trackable - Hours Spent in learning a skill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After hundreds of tournaments played and thousands of strokes tallied , the difference between the No . 1 – ranked golfer and the No . 10 golfer is an average of 0.32 strokes, but the difference in prize money is more than double ( $ 9.6 million versus $ 4.6 million ) ! The No. 1 golfer isn’t five times better, not even 50 percent or 10 percent better . In fact, his average score is only 0.5 percent better. Yet the results are more than double !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Even though you saved for many more years and invested much more cash, you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could have had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate and neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. Don’t wait another day to start the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The key is to start NOW</strong>. Every great act , every fantastic adventure , starts with small steps . The first step always looks harder than it actually is.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-3-habits">Chapter 3: Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life !&rdquo; the teacher exclaimed. &ldquo;The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to even try.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>From what we’ve already discussed , you know successful people aren’t necessarily more intelligent or more talented than anyone else. But their habits take them in the direction of becoming more informed, more knowledgeable, more competent, better skilled, and better prepared.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like Larry Bird, you can condition your automatic and unconscious responses to be those of a developed champion . This chapter is about <strong>choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits</strong>. It’s about becoming a creature of champion habits .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forget about willpower. It’s time for why - power. Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams. The wisest and most motivating choices are the ones aligned with that which you identify as your purpose, your core self, and your highest values. You’ve got to want something, and know why you want it , or you’ll end up giving up too easily.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well said. That’s why it’s not enough to choose to be successful. You have to dig deeper than that to find your core motivation, to activate your superpower. Your why - power .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can all make powerful choices . We can all take back control by not blaming chance, fate, or anyone else for our outcomes. It’s within our ability to create change. <strong>Rather than letting past hurtful experiences sap our energy and sabotage our success, we can use them to fuel positive, constructive change</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you define your goals , you give your brain something new to look for and focus on. It’s as if you’re giving your mind a new set of eyes through which to see all the people , circumstances, conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you. With this new perspective(an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside — your goal. It’s that simple. The difference in how you experience the world and draw ideas, people, and opportunities into your life after you have clearly defined your goals is profound. In one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way :<strong>&ldquo;Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy. And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting blanks without written goals — and that’s the starting point.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I suggest that you take some time today to make a list of your most important goals. I recommend considering goals in all aspects of your life, not just for your business or finances. Be wary of the high price of putting too much focus on any single aspect of your life, to the exclusion of everything else. Go for whole - life success — balance in all the aspects of life that are important to you: business, finances, health and well - being, spirituality, family and relationships, and lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When most people set out to achieve new goals, they ask, “Okay , I have my goal; now what do I need to do to get it? ” It’s not a bad question, but it’s not the first question that needs to be addressed either. The question we should be asking ourselves is : <strong>“Who do I need to become?”</strong> You probably know some people who seem to do everything right, but still don’t produce the results they want, right? Why not ? One principle Jim Rohn taught me is : &ldquo;If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. <strong>Success is something you attract by the person you become</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As you might guess, I don’t watch or listen to any news and I don’t read any news feeds or news publications. Ninety - nine percent of all news has no bearing on my personal life or my personal goals, dreams, and ambitions anyway. I have set up a few RSS feeds identifying the news and industry updates that do pertain to my direct interests and goals. The news that’s helpful to me gets plucked out of the fray so I don’t have to get any mud slung into my glass of water. While most people wade through hours of irrelevant garbage that hampers their thinking and crushes their spirit, <strong>I get the most productive information I need when I need it, in less than fifteen minutes a day</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I once had a neighbor who was deemed a three - minute friend . For three minutes, we could have a great chit - chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. I can hang out with an old high - school friend for three hours, but he’s not a three - day guy  And, then there are some people I can hang around for a few days, but wouldn’t go on an extended vacation with. <strong>Take a look at your relationships. Make sure you’re not spending three hours with a three - minute person</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to let go of some people from you life. They just seem to be very different from the way you are. They have different dreams, different aspirations, different life journeys. Make peace with reality and enjoy your journey.</li>
<li>When I push too hard I push him/her away. I am actually trying to help myself, and not the other way round.</li>

<p><strong>You, too , can have almost any mentor you want</strong>, if he or she has gathered their best thoughts, stories, and ideas into books, videos, and podcasts . You have an unlimited bounty from which to draw. Take advantage of it. Now people often reach out to my assistant in order to get my advice or mentorship. All she has to do is tell them it’s all already available from anywhere in the world through DarrenDaily or inside our Darren Hardy Training Vault.</p>

<p>If you want to have a better, deeper, more meaningful relationship, ask yourself, <strong>“Who has the type of relationship I want? How can I spend (more) time with that person? Who can I meet who can positively influence me?”</strong> Let their glow rub off on you. <strong>Befriend the person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful person in your field. What do they read? Where do they go for lunch? How can that association influence you? You can build these expanded associations by joining networking groups and even online communities. Find the charity organizations, symphonies, and clubs where the people you want to emulate gather</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re never too good for a mentor . My friend Harvey Mackay told me , “I have had twenty coaches, if you can believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, I have a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” <strong>I have always found it interesting that the most successful people , the truly top performers , are the ones willing to hire and pay for the best coaches and trainers there are.

<p><strong>Put another way, you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s amazing how life will organize around the standards you set for yourself</strong>. Some people think they’re the victims of other people’s behavior, but in actuality, we have control over how people treat us. Protect your emotional, mental, and physical space. Then you can live with peace, rather than in the chaos and stress the world will hurl upon you.</p>

<p>But instead of quitting, every time I hit one of those mental and emotional walls, I recognized my competitors were facing the same challenges. I knew this was another moment when, if I kept going, I would gain strides ahead of them. These were the defining moments of success and progress. It wasn’t difficult, painful, or challenging when I was just running with the herd, just keeping up, but not really getting ahead. <strong>It’s not getting to the wall that counts. It’s what you do after you hit it that really matters</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p>It’s the extra effort after you have done your best that is the difference - maker. His team went on to win the game in the second half. That is how you win.</p>

<p>When conditions are great, things are easy, there aren’t any distractions, no one is interrupting, temptations aren’t luring, and nothing is disturbing your stride. <strong>It’s not until situations are difficult, when problems come up and temptation is great, that you get to prove your worthiness for progress. As Jim Rohn would say , “Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better</strong>.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you hit the wall in your disciplines, routines, rhythms, and consistency, realize that’s when you are separating yourself from your old self, scaling that wall and finding your more powerful, triumphant, and victorious self.</p>

<h1>The Compound Effect - Darren Hardy - Summary</h1>
<p>So no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the great defeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. <strong>Countless people have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you , and yet they’re wealthier and more fulfilled</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>This tracking exercise changed my awareness</strong>. As per tracking statistics, I do not spend any time here, and I want to get good at this one. What an Irony. Actually entering such data is very time consuming.</p>
<p>Even though you saved for many more years and invested much more cash, you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could have had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate and neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. <strong>Don’t wait another day to start</strong> the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals!</p>
<hr>
<p>No matter what has happened to you, <strong>take complete responsibility</strong> for it — good or bad, victory or defeat</p>
<hr>
<p>Successful people aren’t necessarily more intelligent or more talented than anyone else. But their habits take them in the direction of becoming more informed, more knowledgeable, more competent, better skilled, and better prepared.</p>
<p>Choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits.</p>
