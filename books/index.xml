      <description>10 Tips to Improve Your Dance 1. Understand the music
Listen actively to lots of music. In particular, learn how to count the beats of music to identify the musical structure. The experts say dance is a three-way partnership between you, your partner and the music. Know the music well.
Always try to dance to music you love; it makes dancing so much easier.
2. Take lessons
You need quality instruction, preferably both classes and, if you’re serious about learning to dance, occasional private lessons.</description>

      <description>The project presented us an opportunity to create a new product that cut across three different divisions and technology stacks of the bank. This was a technology integration challenge, but even more so a challenge of coordination across different divisions. I think the most important action we took was to structure this new e-broking business as a separate organization to ensure it was not caught in the legacy organizational issues. I find it remarkable that more than twenty years later, when I look at large enterprises setting up new digital businesses, the key issues are still organizational – should a new capability be established as a new organization or part of the existing organization?</description>
