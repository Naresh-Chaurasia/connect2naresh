      <title>Digital Age - Nitin Seth</title>

      <description>The project presented us an opportunity to create a new product that cut across three different divisions and technology stacks of the bank. This was a technology integration challenge, but even more so a challenge of coordination across different divisions. I think the most important action we took was to structure this new e-broking business as a separate organization to ensure it was not caught in the legacy organizational issues. I find it remarkable that more than twenty years later, when I look at large enterprises setting up new digital businesses, the key issues are still organizational – should a new capability be established as a new organization or part of the existing organization?</description>
