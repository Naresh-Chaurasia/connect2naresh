<li><a href="#api-management-control">API management control</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consumers-of-microservices-api">Consumers of Microservices API</h3>
<p>Microservices API are consumed by 3 types of consumers, these being <strong>private or internal API consumer</strong>, <strong>public or external consumers</strong>, <strong>partner API</strong>. So depending on the consumer of the API and API is marked as private, public or partner API.</p>
<p><strong>Private or Internal API consumer</strong></p>
<p>The Private or Internal API consumer are microservices that are built by team(s), which are in similar organization.</p>
<p><strong>Public or External consumers</strong></p>
<p>These are the independent developers outside the organization. These developers invoke the publicly exposed APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Partner API</strong></p>
<p>It may be the resellers or the affiliate.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-api-management">What is API Management</h3>
<p>From the developer&rsquo;s / implementation perspective, there is no difference between the three types of APIs. <strong>The difference is in how these apps are managed</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the private API consumer may be able to invoke the API 5000 times per second, whereas the public API consumers will be allowed to invoke the same API five times per second.</p>
<p>Another example is where the private API consumer may be allowed to access all of the API features, whereas the public API consumer will be restricted only to certain get calls on the API.</p>
<p>The above aspects of an API are managed outside of the micro services implementation by way of API management platform. API management platform is a technology that is used for addressing the Common API concerns, like access and authorization of APIs, logging and analytics, Quotas (consumer is allowed to access the API 5000 times per second or five times per second), and API documentation which provides information to the consumers on how to use the apps.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-api-management-work">How does API Management Work</h3>
<p>Micro services expose their APIs by way of these API management platforms. The API management platform exposes the APIs by way of a proxy point. The consumers of the API invoke the API by way of the proxy endpoint. They never connect directly to the API exposed by the micro service where the consumer invokes the API. The API management platform applies the management control and based on the outcome of those controls, the EPA management platform either allows the invocation of the EPA on the micro servers or it denies the request for invocation.</p>
<h3 id="api-management-control">API management control</h3>
<p>Most API management platform offers are declarative or policy based management features. What that means is that the developer of the micro servers doesn’t have to code any of these management controls. They can simply put together policies for defining these controls. For example, a policy may be defined for the internal or private consumer to be such that maximum flexibility is provided to the consumer. So in other words, most of their calls will go through.</p>
<p>For the public domain developers, yhe policy may be extremely restricted for the partnerships. The policy may be such that it define some kind of SLA.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re wondering how these policies are defined, these policy definition mechanism is totally dependent on the API management product. JSON is commonly used for defining these policies. So if you’re interested in knowing more about how these policies are defined, you’ll have to pick up one of the API management products, such as <strong>apigee</strong>, <strong>Mulesoft</strong>, <strong>WSO2</strong> to understand the nature of these policy documents.</p>
<p>Most cloud vendors today also offer API management services like the <strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> and the <strong>Azure API management</strong>. If you’re not using an API management platform, I highly recommend that you look at the possibility of adopting an API management solution.</p>
<p>Although there are multiple benefits of using an API management platform from the micro services development team perspective. The biggest benefit is that the team can focus on the domain or the business logic rather than spending time on common concerns such as security, logging, etc..</p>
<p>As a result, the micro services source code is cleaner. Last but not the least, since the consumers of the EPA do not connect directly to the Microsoft service, change management become easier. So what that means is that the microservices development team can make the changes to the API and adjust the proxy on the API management platform to insulate the end consumer from those changes.</p>

<h1>API and File Based Integration</h1>
<ul>

<li><a href="#common-issues-that-affect-api-integration-and-how-to-avoid-them">Common issues that affect API integration and how to avoid them</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-what">What’s what</h3>
<p>File-based integration is the communication between two systems that occurs via a file that represents the initial data source and its destination data.</p>
<p>To synchronize data with another system, file-based architecture sends a CSV file or a flat file. A CSV file can only contain a single file, whereas a flat file can combine elements from a number of files. File transfer is required when systems store data in tables; that’s often the case with e-commerce programs or legacy systems where there’s no accessible API.</p>
<p>Advanced business systems can require real-time data transmission, and that’s where API integration has the upper hand. API allows you to establish a connection between two systems with the help of cloud applications.</p>
<p>You can utilize one of them exclusively, but file-based and API integration can complement each other, depending on your company’s needs. Let’s take a closer look at the possible difficulties of each and how to overcome them.</p>
<h3 id="major-challenges-around-file-based-integration-and-how-to-prevent-them">Major challenges around file-based integration and how to prevent them</h3>
<p>File-based integration is mostly used in legacy systems and is much more time-consuming than API integration, that’s why developers don’t like it much. This approach presents several challenges. For example, McKinsey mentions the following ones. We offer some tips on how to avoid each of them.</p>
<p><strong>Limited exception handling on format mismatches</strong></p>
<p>Some nondigestible formats, like phone numbers, only require format normalizations. In other cases, not only format but also data would need to be standardized. There are several solutions to the problem: using an open-source universal identifier, standardizing with Excel or scripts and APIs, and utilizing standardization software depending on the data type.</p>
<p><strong>Manual failure recovery following network or system outages</strong></p>
<p>To recover lost or corrupted data, utilize the business rule management system (BRMS). One indispensable feature of this software is a sequence of reports that allow you to recover the system bit by bit. From the reports, you’ll find out how much of the system is damaged and learn a set of instructions on how to restore it. The BRMS allows you to bring back your entire system or separate items of choice, including control groups, libraries, folders, ASPs, spooled files, or integrated file system links.</p>
<p><strong>Weak controls for file tampering and man-in-the-middle breaches</strong></p>
<p>Robust security is a must to avoid data encryption by attackers, who mostly conduct such attacks to receive a ransom. Here are the ways to avert this kind of attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encrypt the stored and transmitted data first—outsmart the attackers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure snapshots are taken each time a database is modified by integrating COW (copy-on-write)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize HMAC to sign messages or files: a shared secret key will ensure the data transferred and received is authentic and unmodified by a third party</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiate file integrity monitoring (FIM), which checks a wide range of files, including encryption key stores, and alerts you once it detects any changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish write once read many (WORM) systems to make sure data cannot be changed or erased accidentally or deliberately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when an actor intercepts a communication of two systems to steal data. To enhance systems against this type of attack, upgrade your website to HTTPS protocol and configure it to exclude any leftover HTTP. Also, ensure the use of TLS 1.1 and 1.2 server protocols and disable all other protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time-consuming customer onboarding (4–6 months)</strong></p>
<p>One way to streamline the onboarding process is to integrate an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) solution. This platform, underpinned by API, ensures apps are integrated in a standardized way, which allows onboarding automation and quick and easy data exchange across applications.</p>
<p><strong>Bulky file formats for enterprise resource planning (ERP) integration, requiring customization for each company</strong></p>
<p>To process and transfer large files, you’ll need the tools and processes to break the large data files into small enough chunks. INSART can provide you with the solutions to solve this problem in a quick and efficient way.</p>
<p><strong>Higher operating cost to run and maintain the specialized software needed</strong></p>
<p>As we mentioned before, API integration and file-based integration can be used in parallel. Using APIs is usually more cost-efficient, because instead of amplifying the range of software used (which often requires special expertise), you can connect to another product and transfer data securely in real time.</p>
<h3 id="common-issues-that-affect-api-integration-and-how-to-avoid-them">Common issues that affect API integration and how to avoid them</h3>
<p><strong>Adoption and transition bottlenecks</strong></p>
<p>To avert confusion and delays, make sure running is easy and the process is clear. Take into consideration legacy systems and old versions and put them into the adoption context to prevent unexpected failures.</p>
<p><strong>A lack of API flexibility, consistency, and standards in services</strong></p>
<p>Switching is expensive. That’s why it’s crucial to build the base for the future: come up with a strategy, choose only the tools you need, make the process consistent, document it, and set security standards to protect data. Also, it’s important to know what data you have and what to do with it: don’t miss an opportunity to monetize.</p>
<p><strong>Backward compatibility</strong></p>
<p>Someone can, for instance, swap out, unknown to an integrator currently working on the integration. Everyone should be aware of the steps being followed in the integration process, so communication is key.</p>
<p>Technical debt due to legacy code with multiple layers is a whole load of extra work that hinders progress. Infrastructure as code and containerization techniques can help you avoid the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Poor security and documentation</strong></p>
<p>A lack of documentation or outdated information results in delays and lots of implementation bugs, so make sure that the process of building an API is thoroughly documented.</p>
<p>Unclear integration requirements is another problem. Rather than pursuing some other purposes, put the application user first.</p>
<p>Security vulnerabilities may lead to data breaches and losses. Ensure proper security standards and practices to save finances and business. Our materials on security can provide you with valuable insights.</p>
<p>Optimizing for systems
The ultimate consumer of your API will be a computer system, not a human. This means that some usual intuitions like minimizing the number of steps in a workflow don’t apply; it’s more important to make the building blocks as intuitive as possible for developers to build this computer system.</p>
<p>Lack of consistency in API development
Define your versioning strategy carefully, as developing APIs is like developing a language; changing APIs can break the computer system built on top of it.</p>
<p>Assessing usability
Consider creating either a client library for the API or a dummy application that consumes the API in parallel with the API itself. This allows you to create quicker feedback loops to test the usability of your APIs.</p>
<p>Other issues
API design management where new apps keep being added
Vague and unclear error messages
Unannounced changes
The backend coding that is required to integrate with existing services is a complex and time-consuming endeavor
Releases only once in two months—it’s impossible for integration to catch up since it takes three weeks to three months to fix one integration</p>

<h1>Microservices Reference Implementation</h1>
<h4 id="what-is-microservices">What is Microservices</h4>
<p>Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services, communicating through lightweight protocols, that are</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly maintainable and testable</li>
<li>Loosely coupled</li>
<li>Independently deployable</li>
<li>Organized around business capabilities</li>
<li>Owned by a small team</li>
</ul>
<p>The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="monolith-vs-microservices">Monolith V/s Microservices</h4>
<p>We have a monolithic application which can be a single springboot application with multiple controller classes. Each controller class is responsible for one particular domain or a business capability, like, for example, working with users or working with a product or a search functionality. But all of these controllers are in one single springboot application. And if you make a change to any of these controllers, then you have to rebuild and redeploy the entire application.</p>
<img src="/connect2naresh/technical/microservice-ri/../images/monolith-microservice.png">
<p>If we look at Microservices architecture, then here we have multiple smaller web services rather than one a large monolithic Web service. This Web services are much smaller and each service is responsible for it&rsquo;s one thing for one particular  business capability. One Web service is responsible for working with user resource, like, for example, create and update user details while on the Web service is responsible only to perform the email verification functionality. These Web services can also be implemented in different programming languages and the hosted on different platforms.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-spring">What is Spring?</h3>
<p><strong>Meet the Spring Family</strong></p>
<p>The Spring family all began with the creation of the Spring Framework, which was built largely in response to the complexity of developing applications using Java&rsquo;s enterprise framework called J2EE, it&rsquo;s now called Java EE, and the Spring Framework aimed at removing the complexity and helped to make things like web development and data access easier for developers to implement. It also aimed at reducing boilerplate code, and if you&rsquo;re not familiar with what that is, it&rsquo;s repetitive code that&rsquo;s often needed as part of the logic, but tends to clutter the application and draw focus away from the main logic. The Spring Framework is still heavily used today, and it&rsquo;s the foundation upon which everything else is built. The success of the Spring Framework led to the creation of several Spring projects that were built on top of the Spring Framework, but tailored to specific needs or domains. For example, the Spring Security project was created to remove the complexity and challenges with securing a Java application, and another project, like the Spring Data project, was created to further simplify data access in Java applications. The Spring Framework and Spring projects continued to evolve and thrive, eventually resulting in the creation of a particularly impactful project called Spring Boot. Spring Boot was a real game changer. It provided a new and drastically faster way of building Spring-based applications. Up until Spring Boot, building a Spring-based application had always involved a lot of choice making, configuration, and a cumbersome deployment model. Spring Boot removed all of that by taking an opinionated view of building Spring-based applications including sensible defaults for library choices and configuration, and adding smarts for auto-detecting and auto-configuring other common configurations. It also massively simplified the deployment process and made running a Spring-based application as simple as running a single command. Lastly came the Spring Cloud project. Spring Cloud was built on top of Spring Boot and simplified the development of applications that make use of distributed architectures, such as microservice architectures, and these type of architectures often have many common patterns that are implemented, such as service discovery and distributed configuration, and Spring Cloud helped to make it easier for developers to build applications that use those patterns. Now that we&rsquo;ve been introduced to the Spring family, let&rsquo;s take a look at why we would want to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Why Spring?</strong></p>
<p>So why Spring? And oftentimes you&rsquo;ll hear people asking, why would I want to use Spring? And that&rsquo;s probably something you may be even thinking for yourself right now. And one of the common answers you&rsquo;ll hear is that it&rsquo;s a good alternative to Java EE, and while that was true in the beginning, today Spring is so much more than just an alternative to Java EE. In fact, it&rsquo;s actually complimentary to Java EE and makes use of several of the standard specifications like the Java Persistence API. The question of why you would want to use Spring is a completely valid and reasonable question that actually has a very simple answer, and that&rsquo;s that creating software can be hard, seriously, and Spring helps make it easier. You&rsquo;ll notice that regardless of the project within the Spring family, they all share a common theme, and that&rsquo;s to make developing Java applications easier. Let&rsquo;s talk about some other reasons why Spring is a good choice. First, Spring is really great at being flexible, modular, and especially backwards compatible. So Spring is far from an all‑or‑nothing type of choice. In fact, you&rsquo;re given the freedom to pick and choose whichever parts of Spring make the most sense for your project. And what&rsquo;s really great about that is that you can be sure that the investment you&rsquo;re making with Spring won&rsquo;t be wasted when a new version is released. Spring also has a very large and active community, and in my opinion this is often one of the things that&rsquo;s overlooked and taken for granted when assessing technologies, but it makes a huge difference. With Spring, you can be sure that there&rsquo;s a wealth of knowledge that already exists out there, and if you run into a problem, it&rsquo;s likely that someone else has already ran into that same problem, and they can probably help you through it. And lastly, what makes Spring a good choice is that it&rsquo;s continually innovating and evolving. Being an open‑source project but fully backed by a company called Pivotal allows Spring to remain healthy and alive, while at the same time pushing the bounds of enterprise Java development. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for Java&rsquo;s standards or specifications to be influenced or based on ideas that originated within Spring.</p>

<h1>Why Python</h1>
<h3 id="why-python">Why Python?</h3>
<p><strong>Simple to Learn</strong></p>
<p>Python is very simple to learn. Very minimal computer knowledge is required to learn and use Python. You don&rsquo;t need to know the difference between computer memory and a hard drive, you don&rsquo;t need to know what an operating system is, you don&rsquo;t need to know what a compiler is, nor do you need to know about build systems, and you don&rsquo;t need to learn any other programming languages first. Whether you&rsquo;re new to computers or not, you can learn Python. Python is also built with a goal to be easy to read and understand.</p>
<p><strong>Simple to Use</strong></p>
<p>There are several core tenets of the Python programming language that makes it simple to use. One of the first tenants contributing to Python&rsquo;s ease of use is that there is usually only one way to do things. Some programming languages believe strongly in flexibility, that the developers should be able to solve a given problem in many different ways. Python is not one of these languages. Being able to solve a single problem many ways is like having a large box of building blocks without any instruction book, or it can be like sitting in front of a blank canvas and being able to paint anything you want. At times, this feeling can be very freeing. When you are first using a programming language, though, constraints are very good to have. They provide guardrails that helped guide you to a likely solution. The constraints help point you in a direction that will help you maintain your forward momentum. This single way to accomplish a task also translates to Python&rsquo;s next tenant. Python focuses on simplicity. That simplicity translates to ease of use. Excess complexity introduces confusion. Let&rsquo;s say you were wanting to learn to use a new device. If there are lots of knobs to turn, levers to pull, and buttons to push, it can be difficult to figure out how to use that device, but with a simplified and intuitive interface, what needs to be done becomes clear and more obvious. That&rsquo;s why a language that focuses on simplicity like Python is simple to use as well. Finally, Python and its community encourages beautiful code. The focus on beauty makes it a more pleasurable experience to use. When you don&rsquo;t enjoy using something, it makes it more difficult to continue using that thing. If something brings you joy, though, it increases your desire to continue using it. The Python community has come to embrace this principle when building Python features. For these reasons, and more we&rsquo;ll investigate in our next module, Python is a programming language that is simple to use.</p>
<p><strong>Great Community</strong></p>
<p>A large contributing factor to Python being simple to learn and use is thanks to support from Python&rsquo;s great community. The Python community has driven many core principles into Python, which has helped it become what it is today. The community involvement can be seen directly in how Python is supported and how Python is developed as a language. The community provides great support for developing Python code. You can see this in the countless third‑party Python packages and code libraries that are available, the great third‑party tools that can be used when using Python, and much more. We will take a closer look at these later in this course. Python&rsquo;s development is also conducted largely through community‑driven proposals called Python Enhancement Proposals, also known as PEPs. This process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding proposals are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community. This has enabled Python to evolve as a shared language and evolved to user&rsquo;s changing needs over the many years. Many of the principles we&rsquo;ve already covered in this course were arrived at as part of this process.</p>
<p>High Demand
Python continues to grow in popularity, and the ability to work with Python is a skill that&rsquo;s increasing in demand in the industry. In even the recent past, when many developers thought of popular programming languages, they tended to think of Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, and perhaps even PHP. Python didn&rsquo;t usually come to mind. But according to some recent Stack Overflow analysis, Python has now overtaken other languages like Java, C#, and C++ based on Stack Overflow question views. And according to PYPL, the PopularitY of Programming Language Index, Python is now the most popular programming language, with its popularity continuing to grow each year. And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Python has the highest spectrum rating according to the recent IEEE Spectrum report, and the TIOBE index now has Python in the top three of programming languages worldwide. All this to say, there&rsquo;s really no longer any denying that Python is a popular programming language and a great language to invest your time into learning.</p>
<hr>
<p>Widely Used
Over its many years of usage, Python has continued to grow and has become increasingly powerful and capable. Python has been used anywhere from special effects in movies like Star Wars to application scripting support in the popular open source, 3D modeling application, Blender. Four areas I&rsquo;ll highlight where Python has seen widespread use are web development, data science, education and learning, and scripting. As we briefly discuss each, it&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t understand what each area is or how Python is used within it. With these examples, I&rsquo;m just aiming to emphasize that Python is widely used in many different areas.</p>
<p>Web Development
The first area we&rsquo;ll discuss where Python has seen growing use is in the area of web development. There are many different buckets or styles of web development. You might be developing just an HTTP or REST API and, hence, not dealing with front‑end user interfaces, just back‑end service code. Or, you might be building a full‑stack web application that touches both the client and the server. You might even be working with an out‑of‑the‑box content management system application, ERP application or an application of a different flavor. No matter which it is, though, there&rsquo;s a Python solution out there for you. If you&rsquo;re building APIs, you can find existing popular Python frameworks like Flask, Bottle, Pyramid or a myriad of others. And the same goes with full‑stack web development. You have popular frameworks like Django, TurboGears, web2py, and many others at your disposal. And for the full, self‑contained web applications, you can find apps like Plone, django CMS, Mezzanine, and more. Basically, no matter what type of web application you&rsquo;re developing, Python is being used out there today and can likely meet your needs too.</p>
<p>Data Science
Data science is a field that is growing in popularity with each passing week. Data science itself is an exceptionally large field. Two common areas that tend to be wrapped up in the data science field are those of big data and machine learning. Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at both of them. So what is big data? As developers, we&rsquo;re used to thinking of data in terms of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, but data is growing rapidly. More and more systems are needing engineers to start thinking in the terms of terabytes, petabytes or, in some cases, even exabytes. Yes, exabytes. The amount of data being generated each day is growing rapidly and shows no signs of stopping. As of 2012, 2.4 EB of new data were generated every single day. To put that in perspective, that is 2.5, followed by 18 zeros. Datasets have grown so large that existing data processing systems are unable to deal with them. New systems are needed. This is where the growing popularity of technologies like Hadoop and MapReduce are coming from. What used to be a problem faced primarily by large companies like Google or Microsoft is now starting to be faced by smaller enterprise businesses. The more data we have available to us, the more we can spot new business trends, find correlations to help prevent new diseases, combat crime, and so on. And Python is a popular programming language used in this space. Now, machine learning is not directly related to big data; however, the more data we have available to us, the more powerful machine learning becomes. So what is machine learning? Today we are surrounded by data everywhere. It comes in all forms, shapes, and sizes. It might come from large text files, or it might be generated by the actions of users. It may be the large amount of metadata available in pictures and videos, or it might be networks and graphs of relationships people have with each other. The many relationships that might exist between all this data is potentially much more complex than any single person or group of people could find. It&rsquo;s like finding a needle in a haystack. So instead, algorithms are written in such a way that a computer can process all the data and find its own connections between the many different sources. Machine learning is now commonly used in several different places. It can be used to help determine whether a given piece of email is spam or not, it can be used to help detect possible network intrusions by using the vast amount of network traffic to detect what is abnormal or not, it&rsquo;s used for optical character recognition to convert images of text into text data that a computer can understand and process, or it can be used for computer vision problems like face detection, object tracking, and motion tracking, and new uses for machine learning are being discovered every day.</p>
<p>Education and Learning
Python is widely used in education and learning, and its popularity continues to grow in the field. Python is getting wider adoption as a language to use when teaching basic STEM skills to younger students across the world. It&rsquo;s also being used as a first programming language in which to teach people programming in the first place. This usage is not just for younger students either, as Python is becoming more popular as a language to teach programming in college courses around the world as well. Python is being used as an education tool to teach people more about computing hardware as well via accessible maker devices like the Raspberry Pi and the micro:bit. Another great way Python is used in education is via Jupyter Notebooks. Sometimes the best way to learn is through interaction and exploration of what code does and the consequences of changing a given piece of code. Jupyter Notebooks, a project that grew out of the interactive Python interpreter IPython are a great way to share different topics with people and to encourage people to explore a given topic in an interactive way that can be changed in code. Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity lately, especially in the data science space, and is pushing forward the concept of interactive education, especially in computer programming.</p>
<p>Scripting
One of the most common uses of scripting with Python is to perform administration of computers When writing scripts to administer a machine, it&rsquo;s routine to work with folders and files on the machine, perhaps managing a series of log files or examining and monitoring the file system. Or we might be dealing with the configuration of apps and services. We can monitor the processes running on a system, keeping an eye on any potential runaway processes that need to be kept in check. We may even deploy a new application, deploy new versions of an existing application or remove older applications that are no longer used. Python supports performing any of these tasks. The main limit is our imagination. We have full access to the wide variety of Python libraries that are already out there or that we are creating from scratch. The last area we&rsquo;ll discuss is application scripting. One way to think of application scripting is to think about how we typically think of an application itself. As a user, we typically don&rsquo;t think of an application as something that can be easily extended by us. The application is exactly what we&rsquo;re given, no more, no less. But what if a user or developer could write their own code to respond to events that are raised within the application, or, going even further, what if a developer could write their own user interface elements, new screens, new user flows or something else and integrate it directly into the application itself? Not many applications written today take advantage of how powerful a concept this is. Games are one type of application that this is more common, but it&rsquo;s less common to find this in your typical application outside of that area. But this is exactly what application scripting aims to do, and is one area Python can be used to a powerful degree. You can find it in 2D and 3D modeling software, image manipulation software in the form of different image processing algorithms, photo taking applications in the form of fun overlays over pictures, and other types of applications as well.</p>
