* **Iteration1**: Don't worry, keep making notes. You can trim later.
* You don't need to capture every important line from the book to change your life.
* **Whatever you've already highlighted and noted is more than enough**.
* Even if you truly apply just 25% of what you've written down, your life will shift in meaningful ways—because **transformation doesn't come from re-reading or perfect notes**, it comes from lived action.
* Books give direction, but implementation gives results.
* **Trust that what mattered most you have already noted, and now your only job is to practice it**.

Never mind … join the crowd! Fear seems to be epidemic in our society. We fear beginnings; we fear endings. We fear changing; we fear "staying stuck". We fear success; we fear failure. We fear living; we fear dying.

* Everyone has some or the other fear.
* It is important what you do inspite of your fears.
{{< /callout >}}

I believe it is primarily **an educational problem**, and that by **reeducating the mind**, you can accept fear as simply a **fact of life** rather than a barrier to success.

{{< callout comment >}}
* The only way to reeducate is that know that there will always be feat. Inspite of that keep acting, keep moving.
{{< /callout >}}

Part of my problem was the nonstop little voice inside my head that kept telling me, "YOU'D BETTER NOT CHANGE YOUR SITUATION. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE FOR YOU. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN." You know the one I'm talking about—the one that keeps reminding you, "DON'T TAKE A CHANCE. YOU MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE. BOY, WILL YOU BE SORRY!"

At that moment I knew I was not going to let fear get the best of me. **I would find a way to rid myself of the negativism that prevailed in my life**. Thus, my odyssey began.

An ancient sage once said, "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear." The student was ready, and teachers appeared from all over the place. **I began to read, attend workshops and talk to as many people as would listen**. Diligently following every suggestion and lead, I unlearned the thinking that had been keeping me a prisoner of my own insecurities. I began to see the world as a less threatening and more joyous place; I started to see myself as someone who had purpose, and I experienced the meaning of love for the first time in my life.

Those of you who are reading this book have acknowledged that wherever you are in life at this moment is not exactly the place you want to be. Something needs changing, and until now you haven’t been able to take the steps to change it. Whatever your circumstances, you are ready to start taking charge of your life.

{{< callout comment >}}
* Another rhetoric. No one wants to be where they are.
{{< /callout >}}

I’m not promising that change is easy. It takes courage to mold your life the way you want it to be. There are all sorts of real and imagined obstacles that get in the way. They need not deter you. In your journey through this book you will become familiar with many concepts, exercises and other devices to help you unravel the complexities of fear … and thus help you deal with it.

* how it can be impossible to make a mistake or a wrong decision
* how to let go of negative programming
* how it is impossible to be conned how to say “yes” to all circumstances in your life
* how to **raise your level of self-esteem**
* how to **become more assertive** how to connect with the powerhouse within
* how to **create more love, trust and satisfaction**
* how to deal with resistance from significant others as you take more control of your life
* how to **experience more enjoyment**
* how to make your **dreams become a reality**
* how to see yourself as having **purpose and meaning**

**The amount of improvement you experience will depend on how much you are willing to participate actively**. Also, the more you get involved, the more fun you will have. You will be surprised and pleased at the amount of satisfaction that comes as you take each little step forward.

No matter what degree of insecurity you are feeling, a part of you knows there is a lot of wonderful “stuff” within you just waiting to be let out and NOW is the perfect time for opening the door to the power and love within.

###   😨 1. What Are You Afraid Of… and Why?

* Don wants to change his career of fourteen years and follow his dreams of becoming an artist.
  * **ME**: Career change. Nah. Enjoying dancing and sharing knowledge once in a while. I want to do justice to myself, and go as far as I can in Salsa and Bachata. FUCK the age and what people think.

* Mary Alice is an actress who wants to discover why she finds all kinds of excuses for not attending auditions.
  * **ME**:I really want to know why I am afrid of going on stage, and joining performances, competition. I am not sure about this one. If I can find some good dancers on socials, that make me happy and content.
  * @**Coursera**: Perfectionist attitude to avoid shame / embarassment. When I look at **less people**, I feel like I don't want to embrass myself by dancing like this.

* Sarah wants to leave a marriage of fifteen years.
  * **ME**:I am so afraid of getting into relationship. FUCK relationship. I am afraid to tell myself that I am in love.

* Teddy wants to get over his fear of aging. He is all of thirty-two.
  * **ME**:I am so afraid of getting old. I keep thinking what good I am going to do with my remaining years or what I have achieved so far.

* Patti wants to expand her business, but can't make the required leap into the next step.
  * **ME**:I want to grow as trainer, doing side hustle. I am afraid of the hard work invoved, and conflict of interest.

* Kevin wants to get over a fear of rejection that makes it very difficult to ask a woman for a date.
  * **ME**:I am so afraid asking out a girl I like. Sometime it is my age, my hair, height etc. I am just not good enough.

* Richard is retired and feels useless. He fears his life is over.
  * **ME**:Another 12 years, and my Job life will be over. With no social circle, what will I do.

First, my students begin to realize **they are not the only ones in the world feeling afraid**. Second, they begin to see how **attractive people become as they open up and share their feelings**.

Although the backgrounds and situations of the class members vary greatly, it does not take long for the surface layers of their particular stories to disappear, opening the way for **everyone to touch on a very human level**. **The common denominator is the fact that fear is keeping all of them from experiencing life the way they want to experience it**.

Fear can be broken down into three levels. The first level is the surface story, such as the ones described above. This level of fear can be divided into two types: those that "happen" and those that require action. Here is a partial list of Level 1 fears divided into these types:

* If this *Happens*, then what will I do.
* I want to do this, but I am afraid to take action.

**Level 1 Fear**

| Those that “Happen”        | Those Requiring Action             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Aging (Ya)                 | Going back to school               |
| Becoming disabled          | Making decisions   (Ya)                |
| Retirement                 | Changing a career     (Ya)             |
| Being alone (Ya)           | Making friends     (Ya)                |
| Children leaving home      | Ending or beginning a relationship (Ya) |
| Natural disasters          | Using the telephone                |
| Loss of financial security | Asserting oneself     (Ya)             |
| Change                     | Losing weight                      |
| Dying                      | Being interviewed (Ya)                 |
| War                        | Driving                            |
| Illness                    | Public speaking                    |
| Losing a loved one (Ya)    | Making a mistake     (Ya)              |
| Accidents                  | Intimacy                     (Ya)      |
| Rape                       |                                    |

* There is nothing that I can do about **happening**.
* There is always something that I can do about **action**.

One of the insidious qualities of fear is that it tends to permeate many areas of our lives. **For example, if you fear making new friends, it then stands to reason you also may fear going to parties, having intimate relationships, applying for jobs, and so on**.

* I seriously have tried this one number of times, but it did not work out very well for me.

**Level 2 Fear**

| A | B |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| **Rejection**        | Being conned  |
| **Success**          | Helplessness  |
| **Failure**          | Disapproval   |
| **Being vulnerable** | Loss of image |


Level 2 fears have to do with inner states of mind rather than exterior situations. They reflect your sense of self and your ability to handle this world. This explains why generalized fear takes place. **If you are afraid of being rejected, this fear will affect almost every area of your life—friends, intimate relationships, job interviews, and so on**. Rejection is rejection—wherever it is found. So you begin to protect yourself, and, as a result, greatly limit yourself. You begin to shut down and close out the world around you.

**Level 3 Fear**: I can't handle it.

* I can’t handle illness.
* I can’t handle making a mistake.
* I can’t handle losing my job.
* I can’t handle getting old.
* I can’t handle being alone.
* I can’t handle making a fool out of myself.
* I can’t handle not getting the job.
* I can’t handle losing him/her.
* I can’t handle losing my money … etc.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO **DIMINISH YOUR FEAR** IS TO DEVELOP MORE **TRUST IN YOUR ABILITY TO HANDLE WHATEVER COMES YOUR WAY**!

###   🚫 2. Can't You Make It Go Away?

**TRUTH 1**: THE FEAR WILL NEVER GO AWAY AS LONG AS I CONTINUE TO GROW.

{{< callout comment >}}
* If I try to take a step ahead in my life, if I try to grow, there will be fear.
{{< /callout >}}

**TRUTH 2**: THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF THE FEAR OF DOING SOMETHING IS TO GO OUT AND DO IT.

**TRUTH 3**: THE ONLY WAY TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF IS TO GO OUT … AND DO IT.

**TRUTH 4**: NOT ONLY AM I GOING TO EXPERIENCE FEAR WHENEVER I’M ON UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY, BUT SO IS EVERYONE ELSE.

They had to push through a **tremendous** amount of fear to get where they are today … and they are still pushing.

Yes, I guess that is the way I’ve always lived my life, without consciously realizing that’s what I’ve been doing. I can’t remember not being afraid, but it never occurred to me that fear would prevent me from taking the risks necessary to get what I wanted. I just went ahead and did what I had to do to make my ideas work—despite the fear.

If you have not been successful in dealing with fear, you probably never learned the Fear Truths, and interpreted fear as a signal to retreat rather than as a green light to move ahead. **You have tended to play those WHEN/THEN games I mentioned earlier. All you have to do to find a way out of your self-imposed prison is to retrain your thinking**.

**TRUTH 5**: PUSHING THROUGH FEAR IS LESS FRIGHTENING THAN LIVING WITH THE UNDERLYING FEAR THAT COMES FROM A FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS.

Five Truths about Fear

1. The fear will never go away as long as I continue to grow.

2. The only way to get rid of the fear of doing something is to go out … and do it.

3. The only way to feel better about myself is to go out … and do it.

4. Not only am I going to experience fear whenever I’m on unfamiliar territory, but so is everyone else.

5. Pushing through fear is less frightening than living with the underlying fear that comes from a feeling of helplessness.

**2. Can't You Make It Go Away - Anki**

Fear is unavoidable when you grow, but it’s not a stop sign. The only way to reduce fear and build confidence is to act despite it. Everyone feels fear in unfamiliar situations, including successful people. Avoiding action creates helplessness, while pushing through fear leads to growth and self-belief.
