To understand parameters, imagine a model as a **recipe**.
A recipe contains ingredients with specific quantities, such as:

- 2 spoons of sugar
- 1 spoon of salt
- 3 cups of water

Changing these quantities changes the taste of the dish.

A model works in a very similar way.
Inside it are millions of tiny numbers. These numbers are called **parameters**, and they influence how the model understands information, what decisions it makes, and what outputs it produces.

Parameters determine:

- how much importance to give to a word
- which word should come next
- what patterns the model should follow

Just like adjusting sugar or salt can change the flavor, adjusting parameters changes the model’s behavior.

### ⭐ Example to Make It Super Clear

Consider a simple sentence:

> “The cat is on the ___.”

When a model is newly created, all its parameters are random. Because of this, it might make a strange guess like:

> “building”

This happens because the internal numbers are untrained — much like following a recipe that mistakenly uses:

- 10 spoons of salt
- 0 spoons of sugar
- 8 cups of chili

The result would obviously taste bad.

Now imagine showing the model many correct examples.
When the desired answer is **“mat”**, the model updates its parameters each time it guesses wrongly:

- it reduces the influence of the patterns that led to “building”
- it strengthens the patterns that point toward “mat”

This process repeats millions of times.
Slowly, the internal numbers shift toward the right combination. Eventually, the model learns to complete the sentence correctly:

> **“The cat is on the mat.”**

### ⭐ So What Are Parameters?

Parameters are the adjustable internal numbers inside a model that guide how it interprets inputs and generates outputs. They are similar to the salt, sugar, and spice levels in a recipe — small values that collectively determine the final result.

Through training, these parameters keep changing until the model consistently produces accurate and meaningful responses.

### ⭐ One-Line Explanation

**Parameters are the tiny internal settings that get tuned while the model learns.**
