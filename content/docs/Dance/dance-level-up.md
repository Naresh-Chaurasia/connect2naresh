### 🕺 My Dance Journey Snapshot

I started dancing **a couple of years ago**, but I became **serious in the last 3 years**.
I **train regularly**, take **formal dance classes**, and have built a strong foundation in **Salsa**, while now **shifting deeper focus to Bachata** (without abandoning Salsa).

Dance for me is not casual fun — it’s a **discipline, a craft, and a form of self-respect**.

### 🔥 My Mindset Shift: From Self-Mastery to Stage

Till now, my goal was **self-mastery**.
Recently, that has evolved into a desire to **perform and compete**.

This shift means:

* I am willing to be seen and judged
* I want to test my skills under pressure
* I want accelerated growth, not comfort

This is my transition from **good social dancer → serious performer**.

### 🎯 My Current Strengths

* My isolations are strong
* My leads are clear and confident
* I train with discipline and consistency
* I have good body control and awareness

These strengths give me a **huge advantage** moving forward.

### 🎵 My Current Weakness (and Growth Focus)

* Musicality is my main weakness
* I am **actively and consciously working on it**

This is a *refinement problem*, not a foundation problem — and that’s a good place to be.

### 🚀 How I Intend to Level Up

#### 1️⃣ Narrow My Focus

I will train **one edge at a time** (musicality right now).
Everything else will stay in maintenance mode.

#### 2️⃣ Use Stillness as a Tool

For me, musicality means:

* Responding to the music, not moving continuously
* Letting movements *earn* the music
* Using pauses, accents, and intention

#### 3️⃣ Train Musicality Separately

I will practice musicality **solo**, without a partner or complex patterns, so my body learns to *listen*.

### 🎤 My Performance Reality Check

#### Performance and competition will:

* Expose weaknesses faster
* Accelerate growth brutally
* Demand sharper focus (styling, musicality, conditioning, mindset)

###

I accept this pressure because it is the **fastest path to excellence**.

### 🧠 My Core Insight

I am past the phase of:

> “Can I do this?”

I am now in the phase of:

> “How far am I willing to push myself?”

With my discipline, control, and mindset, **musicality is the final unlock** that will make my dancing look *intentional, mature, and powerful*.
