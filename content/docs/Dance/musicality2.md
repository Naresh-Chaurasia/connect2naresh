### 🎶 Phrase Awareness — Dance in Sentences, Not Words

**Goal**
Make your movement *start, develop, and resolve* with the music.

#### 🧩 What a Phrase Means (Practically)

* Most Bachata phrases are **8 or 16 counts**
* Music naturally *breathes* at phrase boundaries
* Strong dancers reset intention at every phrase

#### 🛠️ How to Train (10–15 min, solo)

**Step 1: Listen First (No Dancing)**

* Play one Bachata song
* Count quietly: 1–8, 1–8
* Mark:

  * Phrase start
  * Phrase end
  * Big musical changes (instrument drop, vocal entry)

**Step 2: One Idea per Phrase**

* Dance the same song
* For each phrase, choose **ONE concept only**:

  * Smooth flow
  * Sharp hits
  * Slow control
  * Stillness + small accents
* Complete the idea by phrase end
* Reset intention at the next phrase

**Rule**

* ❌ No random changes mid-phrase
* ✔ Commit → complete → reset

#### ✅ Self-Check

* Could someone clearly see where my phrase started and ended?
* If not, simplify further

### ⏸️ Stillness & Delay — Make the Music Earn Your Movement

**Goal**
Create power by *not moving continuously*.

#### 🧠 What Stillness Really Is

* Not freezing
* **Contained energy + delayed reaction**

Think: *I heard the accent — I choose when to respond.*

#### 🛠️ Stillness Training (10–15 min)

**Drill 1: The 50% Rule**

* Dance a full song
* Use only **50% of your normal movement**
* Focus on:

  * Weight transfers
  * Torso reactions
  * Breath timing

If it feels empty, that’s restraint learning.

**Drill 2: Delay on Accents**

* On musical accents:

  * Wait **half a beat**
  * Then move with intention

Late > early
Controlled > fast

**Drill 3: Pause with Purpose**

* Insert pauses:

  * At phrase starts
  * Before big accents
* During pauses:

  * Maintain posture
  * Maintain eye focus
  * Maintain breath

Stillness must look *alive*, not dead.

#### ✅ Self-Check

* If you look busy → too much movement
* If you look calm but intentional → correct

### 🔑 How Phrase & Stillness Work Together

* **Phrase awareness** decides *where* to act
* **Stillness & delay** decide *when* to act

Social dancers move all the time.
Performers choose moments.

### 📅 Weekly Minimum Commitment

* 20–30 minutes per session
* 3–4 sessions per week
* Solo practice only
* Repeat the same 2–3 songs (don’t keep changing music)

Lock this for **4–6 weeks** to see visible maturity in your Bachata.
