#### 🎯 The Sweet Spot

You don’t need a lot of Salsa to maintain your shine energy.

#### ✅ Minimum Effective Dose

- 2 times per week
- 12–15 minutes
- 1–2 fast songs
- Full intensity, no stopping

That’s enough to maintain:

- Speed
- Stamina
- Sharpness

#### 🔁 Mindset

Think **maintenance mode**, not improvement mode.

Your Salsa base is already strong — it just needs small, consistent reminders.
