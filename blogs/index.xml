      <description>I have waited forever to stop waiting and took my first solo trip to Pawna Lake. That winding roads, the scenic landscape, the setting sun, the floating clouds had me calling, since forever.
It was a day to remember. While driving, soaking in the sound of gushing wind and nature, watching the sun slowly retreat behind the hills, with vast open fields all around.
After parking my HARRIER, it was a small walk to the lake.</description>
