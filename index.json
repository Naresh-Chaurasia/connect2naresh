HTTP Method Testing\nGET: Retrieve data from an API. POST: Send data to the server. PUT: Update existing data. DELETE: Remove data from the server. PATCH: Partially update resources. Validating Responses\nStatus Code Validate HTTP response code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found). Headers Assert presence and values of headers like Content-Type, Authorization, etc. Body Validate fields in JSON or XML response using path expressions. Authentication\nBasic Authentication Pass credentials using .auth().basic(username, password). Token-Based Authentication Use .auth().oauth2(token) for Bearer tokens (commonly used in REST APIs). Custom Headers Add custom Authorization headers when needed. Request Parameters \u0026 Payloads\nQuery Parameters Use .param(\"key\", \"value\") or .queryParam(). Path Parameters Define placeholders in the endpoint URL. Request Body Send JSON, XML, or form data as payload using .body(). Assertions with Hamcrest\nUse expressive matchers for validating response: equalTo(), hasItems(), containsString(), etc. Enables readable assertions like: then().body(\"name\", equalTo(\"John\")); Logging and Configurations\nEnable request and response logging: .log().all() or .log().body() Configure timeouts, proxies, and base URI using RestAssured.config. File Uploads/Downloads\nUpload files using .multiPart() method. Download files and validate content type, size, etc. TestNG / JUnit Integration\nUse REST-Assured inside test methods. Combine with test annotations for setup, teardown, and grouping. Create reusable test suites and CI pipelines. Best Practices and Hands-on\nUse RequestSpecification and ResponseSpecification for reusability. Externalize base URIs, endpoints, and payloads in config files or constants. Follow clear naming conventions and logging to maintain readable tests. Hands-on practice: Create CRUD tests against public APIs like https://reqres.in or your own mock server. 🚀 Projects Project 1 - Java Selenium Automation Project 2 - Java Selenium Automation Project 3 - API Automation using REST Assured Project 4 - API Automation using REST Assured 🎯 Mock Interviews 🛠️ IDE Setup Visual Studio Code IntelliJ Useful Plugins ",

    "content": " 🚀 Evaluating RAG Systems: Measuring Context Precision When we talk about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the real magic lies in how well the system can find the right pieces of information and then use them to answer a question.\nBut how do we know if it’s really doing a good job?\n👉 That’s where Context Precision comes in.\n📑 Table of Contents 🔎 What is Context Precision? 📘 Example 📊 Why Does This Matter? 📝 Key Takeaways 💡 Final Thoughts 🔎 What is Context Precision? In simple terms, context precision measures:\n➡️ Out of all the documents the system retrieved, how many were actually useful in producing the answer?\nIt’s very similar to searching on Google:\n👉 If you click on the top 3 results and only 1 of them helps, the precision is 1/3 = ~33%.\n📘 Example Suppose we ask:\n“How many articles are there in the Selenium WebDriver Python course?”\nThe system answers:\n✅ “There are 23 articles in the course.”\nIt also retrieves 4 chunks of documents:\nRetrieved Chunk Content Summary Useful? 1️⃣ Mentions “23 articles” ✅ Yes 2️⃣ Talks about Java ❌ No 3️⃣ Talks about Python basics ❌ No 4️⃣ General course description ❌ No 📌 Calculating Precision:\nIf we only consider the first 3 chunks: 1 out of 3 useful → Precision = 33% If we consider all 4 chunks: 1 out of 4 useful → Precision = 25% 📊 Why Does This Matter? ✅ A high precision score means the system is pulling back highly focused and relevant context. ⚠️ A low precision score means the system is pulling in noise — irrelevant chunks that don’t help the answer. By measuring context precision, we can evaluate and improve the retrieval step of RAG, ensuring the AI is always grounded in the right evidence.\n📝 Key Takeaways 📌 RAG doesn’t retrieve full documents; it retrieves chunks (paragraphs or sections). 📌 Precision = Useful chunks ÷ Total chunks considered. 📌 This metric helps us judge how well the system is focusing on the right information. 💡 Final Thoughts Think of it like this:\n🔍 Context precision tells us how many of the “search results” the AI actually used to get to the right answer.\n",
