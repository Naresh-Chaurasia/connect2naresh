    "content": " Flat Bench Dumbell Press Flat Bench Barbell Press Decline Dumbbell Bench Press Decline Barbell Bench Incline Dumbbell Bench Press Butterflies / Pec Deck / Seated Machine Flyes References Breath Out When Pushing\nBreath In When Releasing\nFlat Bench Dumbell Press Lie on a flat bench holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.\nStart by holding the dumbbells slightly wider than shoulder width apart above your shoulders. Your palms should be facing forward.\nSlowly bend your elbows until they are at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms are parallel to the ground.\nPush the weights up by straightening your arms.\nAs you push the weights up, move your arms in an arc to bring the dumbbells together, until they meet over the center of your chest. Hold for a count of one.\nLower the dumbbells by slowly bending your elbows back to 90 degrees.\nContinue lowering your arms until they are a little lower than parallel to the floor. (Your elbows should be pointing slightly towards the floor and you should feel a stretch in your chest muscles and shoulders.)\nRepeat\nFlat Bench Barbell Press Feet should be wide apart and flat on the floor (unless the program tells you otherwise) to give your upper body muscles a solid platform from which they can generate power.\nKeep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the exercise. Pull them together before you lower the bar, and keep them together as you lift.\nA grip slightly wider than shoulder width will assure maximum effort from all areas of the chest.\nStabilize by ensuring that your shoulders, head, and hips remain in contact with the bench at all times.\nKeeping your elbow out will ensure you are using more chest and less triceps.\nDo not bounce the bar off your chest or arch your back – this reduces the amount of chest work and risks injury to the chest muscles. You may arch your back (which provides greater power) to complete a set, but only if you have difficulty with the last repeat and you do not have the help of a fellow athlete.\nKeep a firm grip on the bar with your forearms approximately perpendicular to the floor and parallel to each other.\nAvoid dropping the weight quickly.\nIt’s a very good idea to have a spotter on hand who can help lift the bar off your chest if you unexpectedly fail to complete a repetition.\nDecline Dumbbell Bench Press Make sure that your legs are steady at the top of the bench—you don’t want to slide down the bench.\nUse light weight in the beginning, raising and lowering the dumbbells directly over your lower chest.\nForcefully press the dumbbells up in an arc (coming toward each other at the top) until your arms are fully extended above your lower chest or upper abs.\nYour breathing should always be out on extension, which means you are blowing the weight away.\nDon’t bounce the dumbbells at the bottom of the movement.\nFlare your elbows out as the bar is lowered to maximize pectoral isolation.\nIt is not advisable to work out intensely for prolonged periods with the head below the level of the heart. This is because the human body is not designed for effort in an inverted posture.\nThe bench should never be set at a decline of more than about 35 degrees.\nDecline Barbell Bench Slowly lower the resistance to your collarbone, making a conscious effort to keep your elbows wide. To stretch the chest muscles at the bottom of the movement and work your pectoralis muscle harder, spread your elbows as far from your body as possible and use a pronated grip (thumbs facing each other).\nThe weights should travel perpendicular to the floor.\nTo keep your body stable during the exercise, your knees should be at the end of the bench with your lower legs hanging over the end. There should be a support bar to press your feet against for further stability and to keep you from sliding down.\nDo not lift your head up and do not bridge or arch.\nThe lower pectoral is best targeted at a decline of 20 to 40 degrees to the floor. Steeper declines shift the focus from the chest to the triceps.\nThe greater the decline angle, the more weight you’ll be able to use (to a point) due to the decreasing range of motion.\nHave your partner assist by giving you two forced repetitions or two negative repetitions.\nIncline Dumbbell Bench Press Make sure that you raise and lower the weights evenly. Avoid jerking or twisting your body to “muscle” them upwards.\nKeep your back pressed against the bench, your feet flat on the floor.\nThe path the dumbbells travel when performing this exercise is important. When lowering the dumbbells, be sure the initial movement is out and away from your chest rather than straight down. The dumbbells should not hit your chest at the bottom. They should be even and a couple of inches away from the outside part of your chest. Push the dumbbells through the same path on the way up as on the way down.\nThe lower the dumbbells descend, the more the chest muscle stretches. Lowering the dumbbells too far can cause shoulder injury; it is safer to terminate the descent when the dumbbells reach chest level. You should achieve a maximal but comfortable stretch.\nKeep your forearms vertical under the weights. They should move perpendicular to the ground and parallel to each other.\nFlare your elbows out wide during descent. Keeping your elbow out will ensure you are using more chest and less triceps.\nIf you are new to this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. The spotter assists by spotting your forearms near your wrists.\nDo not set the angle of the bench too high otherwise the anterior deltoids will be targeted and take much of the emphasis away from the chest.\nButterflies / Pec Deck / Seated Machine Flyes Sit on a pec deck machine with your back flat against the back rest.\nGrip the handles and make sure your arms are parallel to the floor. If not parallel,adjust the seat or handles accordingly. This is the start position.\nExhale and slowly push the handles together squeezing your chest to the middle as you do so. Hold for a count of one.\nInhale as you return to the starting position in a controlled movement.\nRepeat.\nReferences https://www.anywherefitness.ie/blog/19-variations-of-the-chest-press-exercise https://workoutlabs.com/exercise-guide/dumbbell-bench-press/ https://bodybuilding-wizard.com/flat-barbell-bench-press/ ",

One was my family. One was my job. And most importantly, was my part time business. And I think the part time business is the most sort of important thing, because it was the only way that I could get out of the financial rut that I was in.\nFence Railing - compartmentalization technique So what then happened was I dedicated two hours a day to the part time business using what we call a compartmentalization technique\nFence Pillar - Where You Are Standing in pillar with telescope and watching how far is my goal 3rd and 4th is covered in MAAP firstly, knowing where you are and where you want to be, this is a pretty obvious statement and you might be thinking, I know where I am in life, but you’ll be surprised that the vast majority of people don’t know where they are in life. They don’t know how far away they are from achieving their goals, if they have any in the first place. They also don’t know what their purpose is. You may be one of them.\nThe second aspect is how you plan to bridge that gap and achieve your goals, planning is a fundamental process that one has to do in order to achieve the goals.\nThe third aspect is how you train your mind to achieve your goals. I have mentioned before that mindset required for achieving success is one of the most crucial factors.\nAnd the fourth aspect is how you everything action is usually what separates a person from achieving anything in life, massive, determined and consistent action is the name of the game.\nThere is a saying that I have always lived by, and it was taught to me by one of my mentors. And and the same goes as follows. Thoughts will determine what you want, but action ultimately determines what you get. We will delve deeper into these four aspects in the chapters to follow.\nGreen Bench - MAAP Technique Sitting on bench and drawing a MAAP The M stands for mindset, as mentioned before, mindset is a key component that I have highlighted already.\nThe A stands for awareness awareness is knowing exactly what you want out of life, and again, I have spoken about this in detail previously.\nThe A stands for action, so these are the small, incremental actions that you need to do on a daily basis, actions that are in line with your goals.\nAnd finally, the P, which stands for Planning, and again, as highlighted previously, what planning is required to achieve your goals?\nPark 2 Pillar - Awareness When I look at the Pillar, there is images of me looking back.\nSo awareness, as mentioned before, is knowing exactly what you want out of life. And not only that, knowing where you stand currently is also part of that awareness.\nI don’t mean anything materialistic, like a new car, a new house or any other materialistic things, I mean something that’s deeper. And I need you to think long and hard about it. I want you to write. The first few things that actually popped into your mind, and that’s where you write it in this section. So just take time out, pause this video and just do a little bit of brainstorming and what you actually want out of life.\nWhy do you want what you said you want?\nPark 2 Overhead Railing - Mission Statement So most organizations have this mission statement, which is basically a statement that best describes an organization’s key purpose and value and what it is committed to doing.\nSimilarly, you yourself should have a mission statement that clearly describes what you feel like. Your purpose in life is it clearly separates what’s important and what’s not in your life. And it also describes your values.\nPark 1 Overhead Lamp - SMART Specific\nAn example of a broad term goal is a goal such as I would like more money in my life or I would like a promotion at work.\nI would like to earn ten thousand dollars more this year than last year. I would like to be promoted to the position of general manager. The M stands for measurable, your goals should have some form of monitoring or tracking. So in other words, you should be able to know how far you are away from achieving your goals, whether you’re on track and ultimately finding out when you have finally achieved your goals.\nThe A stands for achievable. So, in other words, how realistic are your goals? Are you able to accomplish it based on your current constraints, such as financial factors or time constraints or resource constraints? Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, I will go back to the example of wanting a promotion at work. You may you may need to step back and ask yourself questions such as do you have the right qualifications or experience to suit that role? If you don’t, then maybe setting another goal, such as developing the experience and qualifications necessary to get that promotion before you actually set the goal of getting a promotion.\nAlso to highlight the example of, for example, wanting more money, you may need to step back and ask yourself, how will you get more money? You won’t get more money by doing the same thing that you’re doing now. So you may need to re-evaluate your goal and change it to having a goal of developing, for example, a second stream of income. That would be a goal prior to having more money.\nThe R stands for relevant, this means that the goal that you have sent have said should be worthwhile and full of meaning to you. Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, if you would like a promotion at work and your overall goal is to be financially free, then is it worth gaining that extra qualification that you need for gaining that experience? Or should you utilize your time in developing another stream of income? Those are the types of questions that you need to ask yourself.\nThe T stands for time based, you need to set a date or some sort of timeline to achieve your goal. It is absolutely critical to assign this date, this deadline date, as mentally you are now under a deadline to achieve that goal.\nGarden 1 Drainage Pipeline If I don’t take care of my goals, they will go down the Drainage\nadventure goals family goals / relationship goals financial goals health goals the next stage is to determine which goals are short term, medium term or long term. It’s time to be realistic at this stage, not all goals can be short term\nPenguin Dustbin - Choose at least five The first step in this is to choose at least five to seven short term goals that you feel are priority for each category. Now, the amount of goals that you choose is entirely up to you. You can choose less or more. The important thing here is that it should be comfortable for you and not too overwhelming and at the same time, not too less.\nThe question here is, how relevant is your goal to your overall mission statement? Is it worthwhile? And is this what you really want in life? And time bound now.\nmake it more smarter, the more smarter your goals, the more specific, the more measurable, the more achievable, the more relevant. And the more time bound they are, the higher your chance of actually achieving your goals\nTrees / Forest - Time And when I do this exercise, it brings into perspective that, yes, they do have time. It’s just how that time is managed and how you how you spend that time\nBench Green Red - Compound Effect So another example is simply reading, for example, 10 pages of a good book every day will equate to reading approximately 10 to 15 books a year\nThen the key to becoming good at them is to know more than what 95 percent of the population know. And the best way to do this is to read books on that particular topic. So, again, if you read an average of 10 to 15 books on a particular topic, then you automatically become an expert in that field. So that’s just food for thought. The reason I’m saying this is that every action that you take towards your goals, no matter how small or trivial they seem, will eventually add up to a bigger result, provided that you remain consistent and determined and that the action is in the right direction\nSpeed Breaker - compartmentalization technique But for now, just think of which colors that you want to assign to each of your goal categories\nGas Pipeline - Belief Systems So belief systems, a simple definition of a belief system is that it is a set of habits which ultimately control an individual’s behavior or actions, both consciously and unconsciously, towards a given task or as a reaction to a given situation\nSo just to refer to the belief system work worksheet. I want you to make a list of your belief systems around the different gold categories once you have made the list of those beliefs, I want you to analyze whether that belief system is in line with your goals\nyour beliefs create your emotions, your emotions, create your actions and your actions ultimately control your outcome\nFire Hose 1 - Your Current Mental Programming Bench Green Color Garden 2 Overhead Railing Garden 2 Pillar Garden 2 Overhead Lamp References ",

I have to come back to this as often as possible. Make it part of my life and you will live your dreams. Go on Naresh, its time to live your dreams!!! I am keeping some location in Memory Palace unused, if need later for some information.\nWe’re going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed, and we’re going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It’s not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programmes out there. It’s a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we’re going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I’m trying to say is this. You’re going to have to work for this, and it’s not going to happen overnight. But, with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we’ve provided, you can and you will succeed.\nSo we want you to limit your practice and studying to no more than 8 hours per week, to prevent fatigue, burnout, and frustration, and also to allow your brain the necessary time to adapt and build the new connections and habits we’re going to be studying\nMain Door Front - Progressive Overload Throughout the course, we’re going to be using a training methodology called progressive overload, progressive overload is a fundamental principle at the core of all strength and fitness training, and it’s applicable to your mental skills as well. The basic idea is to always be training near or just below your limits. You always lift weights that are relatively heavy or run at a pace that is relatively challenging, by doing this, you avoid the injury and the damage and the frustration that could result in training beyond your limits. But you also avoid getting stuck in a rut by not pushing yourself enough. Most importantly, every time you progress, you immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain your progress.\nMain Door Peep Hole - Pomodoro technique Pomodoro technique, which is a method used to prevent fatigue and frustration. Basically, you’ll train for twenty to twenty five minutes and then take a five minute break and then train for another twenty to twenty five minutes and then take another five minute break after four pomodoro or twenty to twenty five minute periods, you’ll take a longer break, a 15 to 30 minutes. This method has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to maintain focus and creativity. So check it out\nMain Door Back - Memory Our brains do use several different types of buffers to work with the various types of information. This basically means that words, ideas, images, and scenes, they don’t all use the same path to get to the short term memory.\nMain Door Ganpati - Buffers Well, once you’ve used your working memory to process, understand, and interact with a piece of information, your short term memory is what keeps it in your mind for about 15 to 20 seconds. This might seem like a really short amount of time, and it is, that’s why for the majority of the course, we’re going to focus on improving the connexion all the way from your working memory to your long term memory. This is because if you do a good enough job creating those short term memories that’ll stick till you get to the end of a page or an article, you’ll only need to use some simple review techniques and regular maintenance to keep things in your long term memory, where we eventually want all our new information to remain.\nThis means that right now, our working and short term memory are the primary bottlenecks. Without the right infrastructure and base skillset to improve these two types of memory, speed reading is pretty useless, even impossible\nMain Door Magnetic Stopper - Neural Network But basically memories are created when your brain sends neurotransmitter signals to two neurons at the same time. This strengthens the connexion between those two neurons and presto, you have a new memory. This is an important point to make because it shows that the creation of memories requires connexion between two neurons or a connexion to existing neurons in your brain. The other thing you need to know is that when this happens over and over again the cluster of neurons and their synaptic connexions become something called a neural network. From artificial intelligence research we know that neurons work better in these types of clusters. This means that when several neurons fire together the signal is actually amplified. That’s why it’s so crucial to store memories in several connected neurons and to further connect them to the memories that we often use.\nBecause there are so many connexions and stories and experiences around that piece of information your brain determines that it’s critical and will never erode it away. Knowing this can benefit us tremendously. The process of super learning necessitates that we create more connexions to the information we want to learn\nWall - neuroplasticity Well first and foremost I want to dispel the myth that children’s brains are somehow better at absorbing new information or that they have a higher neuroplasticity.\nRecent studies have actually shown that this is simply not true. The reason that children seem to learn with more ease is that they’re learning literally every waking hour and all information is new and exciting information for them. Furthermore, research shows that our brains do play by the use it or lose it rule. Most adults lose the ability to learn rapidly simply because they settle into their day-job and they stop learning in the volume that they used to as children, not because their brain chemistry or #neuroplasticity# have actually changed\nWall Bulb Holder - Games Playing games with Wall Bulb Holder and getting electric shock\nSo, as you go along throughout the rest of the course, I want you to remember that the games are important, but that the real test of your super-learner skills is whether or not you can memorise everyday information, speed-read your daily reading assignments, and learn actual skills faster\nWall Switch Board on left - Chunking Chunking - psychological phenomenon\nThe chunking system is very good because it’s an entry level mnemonic technique. It’s not only much faster and easier to learn and play with than some of the heavier visual memory techniques we’re going to learn later, but it’s also a critical element of the overall technique. This is to say that even after we teach you the methods to remember things way more easily, you’re still going to be chunking details or memories into groups of three or four so that they can better comply with the requirements of your short term memory. Sure, we could train your short term memory to hold a larger number of items, but that would only slow you down and place a larger cognitive load on you. At three to five items there is no slow down so it’s preferable to work in this range. Furthermore, by chunking groups of items into one entity, we can stack five chunks of five objects each into our working memory and effectively store 25 items in our short term or working memory without any cognitive overload. Because of this massive advantage, you’ll notice that all of the world’s top memory athletes use systems that are based on chunking combined with powerful visual and spatial memory techniques that we’ll be learning later on in the course. The other nice thing about chunking is that it works with just about everything. Take a sequence of numbers or a couple pieces of information. For example, brown dog, tall fence, lost Frisbee. You can even try to chunk information about people into neat little bundles. It might seem strange, but remembering that information in chunks is actually much easier than if it were to be put all together\nSamsung TV 65 Inches - Dual Coding and Brute Force Learning Dual Coding. Remember how we learned that the brain has different buffers for working memory depending on the type of information it’s interacting with?\nA great example of this, by the way, would be to try and explain to some of your friends what you learned in the last few lectures about your memory and about chunking. By teaching this information, you force your brain to look at it from a different angle, to deconstruct it, to form it into your own words, and then to present it in a compelling way. As they say, something once taught is something twice learned, and we would absolutely love to see you get out there and share what you’ve learned with your friends so far\nSamsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer - Visual Memory \u0026 Marker Well, it means that we can not only spot an approaching predator very quickly, we can also remember visual information, or pictures, far faster and with more clarity than we can remember things like spoken words\nIt also has to do with the fact that pictures are more heavily encoded and they speak to different types of working memory buffers, as we mentioned before. Pictures are imbued with rich and detailed information, such as colour, context, shape, and size, and they’re more likely to have a higher number of neural connexions, as they convey emotion and depth, interaction, and so much more. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Visual information is also alarmingly fast. Research has demonstrated that we can comprehend the contents of an image in just a fraction of a second\nThis little demonstration shows us just how effective it is to see things as pictures and symbols rather than auditory information. For this reason, in addition to all the other steps we have to take to prime our memory, it’s best that we also learn to transform concepts, ideas, and other important information into imagined visual pictures, or what we call markers, as soon as we possibly can. It won’t surprise you to learn, additionally, that the best and most memorable types of visual markers are strange, bizarre, or emotionally connected to memories. After all, adult learners need to connect information to pre-existing knowledge, and as always, our hippocampi are busy working away to determine what stuff matters and what stuff doesn’t\nShe explained to me that she struggled a great deal with this first memorization assignment. This is because they were simply looking at the bones in a diagram, a very undetailed image in a textbook without any emotional connexion or experiential component to it\nHowever, the detailed, experiential images, the emotionally significant experience of interacting with a dead body, and the very concrete, minute details are what allowed her to memorise the ligaments much better than the bones\nUltimately, you have to learn to go with what images come naturally for you. Try to lean towards whatever type of image you find most conductive for you to remember, but just make sure that, number one, there’s as much detail as possible.\nYou’ll also probably develop fixed markers for subjects that you spend a lot of time reading about.\nWith time, you too will build up a visual library like this one, which will make calling up images much faster and make it much easier to link together strings of images to form complex concepts that easily convert into long term memory.\nSamsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer Table - Visual Memory \u0026 Reading How Do We Apply Visual Memory To Reading\nOne of those future lectures will come up when we get to speed reading, and it’ll explain in detail how you’ll use regular intervals of pauses during your reading. This is not just because speed reading is very exhausting for the eyes and for the brain, but also because these pauses allow us to optimise the process of learning\nYou see, just like there are at least three types of memory, there are also three stages, or processes, of memory. They are, encoding, storage, and retrieval. Where most people get into trouble is that they try to do all three at once. Have you ever read a paragraph or a page of text only to realise that you’ve been deeply immersed in thought and you haven’t actually paid attention to anything that you just read? This is what happens when you’re trying to do all three memory processes at once. On the other hand, if you’ve ever studied process operations management or economics, you know that grouping similar tasks together is an efficient way to minimise waste. I mean, you don’t wash one shirt at a time and then put it in the dryer all by itself. You wash all of your clothes together, put them all in the dryer together, and then fold them when they’re all done, right? With reading, you’ve been doing it one shirt at a time, trying to multitask the washing and drying and folding for each shirt. It’s just as inefficient as it sounds, and so we’re going to separate it out into three separate processes to reduce cognitive strain and improve overall efficiency\nNow I know what you’re thinking, how exactly do we do that? Well, because of the limitations on your short term memory and the inherent difficulty in multitasking visualisation with reading, we’ll be learning how to make short pauses of about one to two seconds after each page, or even take micro pauses of just fractions of a second after reading information-dense paragraphs. You’ll also take longer pauses every 10 minutes or less to review what you’ve already hopefully put into the beginning stages of long term memory. As we’re going to discover, when we learn about space repetition software, you brain needs to periodically repeat and review information in increasingly long intervals in order to remember it and prove to the hippocampi that it’s relevant and worth remembering. This is similar to the idea that you must continue weight training to improve your strength and increase muscle mass. If your brain, like your body, thinks that the information you’re using is a one off occurrence, it won’t waste the time investing the resources to remember it.\nIn short, this is why we take small pauses after each page and much longer pauses of 15 to 30 seconds after each chapter, to play back and retrieve our stored markers and perform a form of spaced repetition to improve our long term retention. This also means that it’s not a bad idea to spend a few minutes a week reviewing markers and ideas from books you’ve read months or even years before, if you really wish to remember them\nWhile we’re discussing images and visual markers, it’s worth noting that not all markers have to be visual. In fact, smell is actually a more memorable sense than vision. Of course, we can’t understand an entire book using our sense of smell alone, and so we’re focusing on images, but if you read about, say, chocolate, and you can conjure up the smell or the taste of chocolate, that’s actually a great marker for remembering that data point. And if it works for you, even better. Whatever types of markers we use, whether they’re visual or sensory or some other types that we have yet to learn about, it’ll almost certainly be a mix in the end. This mix of markers, when retrieved and reviewed, reminds us of the details that we’ve decided we need to remember. And when combined with our existing knowledge and opinions and ideas about the content, it allows us to dual code and store information into long term memory very quickly and very effectively\nSo, instead of reading back over the chapter, we can retrieve all of the markers we’ve created and start thinking about how they’re connected together logically. We play them back almost like a film strip in our minds, and that helps our retrieval\nSamsung 11.1.4 Bar TV Unit Top (Light Brown, Old) TV Unit Middle Drawer - TV Unit Left Slot - TV Unit Middle Slot - TV Unit Right Slot - Kitchen Curtain : Starting with Kitchen Curtain Kitchen Counter / Platform Kitchen Top Drawer Unit White in Color (First Up) Kitchen Top Drawer Unit Red in Color (Second Down) Corner Unit Gas Stove Gas Chimney (First Up) Kitchen Window (Upper) Water Tank/Tunki Kitchen Sink Dustbin (Blue in Color) Microwave (Silver in Color) Microwave Stand (With Wheels) Fridge (Blood Red / Passion / Poison Color) Diwan (Chocolate in Color) : : Starting with Diwan Balcony Window Sofa Set Dinning / Sofa Table Window Platform Blinds Corner Table Telephone Speaker (Ceiling) Tubelight Projector ",

I am able to recollect the entire course in \u003c 5 minutes. Thanks to Memory Palace and Jonathan Levi. I will always be greatful to you.\nRamp - Fear Fear and Our Brain’s Default Setting\nIf I had to pick the number one silent killer of our productivity and the biggest thing that holds people back from being as productive as they can possibly be, that would be your own brain and its desire to keep you safe.\nNow, all of us struggle with procrastination from time to time. In fact, in many cases, our procrastination is simply a symptom of fear, whether it be fear of failure, being concerned we won’t live up to expectations or produce good enough work, or even if it’s just a task that’s outside of our comfort zone, we’ll rationalize reason after reason.\nBut it’s not just physical harm that your brain is trying to protect you from. It’s also emotional harm.\nBut because our brain doesn’t distinguish the difference between physical or emotional harm, it wants to avoid both.\nCourage is not the absence of fear. It’s the willingness to act in spite of fear.\nDance Fear - Forgetting Steps, Taking a lot of time to learn, Upset when girl says no.\nPractise and Make a Routine for different dance forms.\nAWS Exam Fear - Device a System, that will help you learn and remember things. To begin with, memory palace and association looks great options.\nLet this be 1st thing that you want to do daily.\nCanada Fear - There is nothing much you can do about it. Keep doing proper follow up and thats all for now.\nSeating Arc - Overwhelm Overwhelm - How it holds you back and how you can beat it\nNow, here’s the thing. When your brain gets overwhelmed, it’s kind of like a breaker being shut off. Your brain just completely shuts down. Now, I hear this from my clients and my students all the time. They’re overwhelmed and they don’t even know where to start. And in many cases, when this happens, they freeze, it paralyzes them and they’re just stuck in the mud. But the problem is those tasks don’t go away. That only makes the problem worse. I do have some good news for you. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. You see, overwhelm really is subjective. It’s much more of an emotion that it is a reality. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way. Please don’t leave this lecture without really internalizing this fact. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way.\nThe first thing you’ve got to do when you get overwhelmed is to get all those thoughts out of your head.\nAnd once you’ve got it on paper, you can then start to organize it and create a plan\nSoft Skill Courses - So many and which one to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\nTechnical Course - So many and which one to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\nToDo - Endless List, what to do what not to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\nDaily Activities - So many of them. Make exhaustive list of everything.\nSoil/Earth - Plan Failing To Plan\nThe first thing that planning is going to do for you is provide clarity now, planning forces you to get clear on what it is you actually want to accomplish. It allows you to really decide how to invest your time and what your most important tasks are. Now, as silly as this sounds, many don’t even know. And it sounds simple, I know, but I can’t tell you how often when I sit down to write out the three most important tasks that I want to accomplish that day, how frequently I pause and have to really give it some serious thought. This is a really critical first step. Another key benefit of having a plan is the locks you in. And once you lock in to your priorities of the day, it’s really going to help you lock out all the distractions and all the things that pop up along the way. They can get you sidetracked. And lastly, a plan creates great subconscious accountability. When you’ve got a system and you’ve got a plan and you actually write out what your top priorities are for the day, I’m telling you, it will nag at you until you get it done. And I’ve found that this will at least double your chance of actually completing that task if you commit to it in writing. Please don’t underestimate the power behind this particular advantage, because be honest, we all love Crosson. Those things off our To-Do list. Now, if you don’t consistently plan your week and plan your day and you’re not doing that already, your job is to start planning your day and planning your week before the end of this course, I’m going to get into more depth and walk through this in more detail in future lectures. But like Benjamin Franklin said, failure to plan is planning to fail.\nSoft Skill Courses - So many and which one to do !\nFollow the plan on Notion.\nTechnical Course - So many and which one to do !\nToDo - Endless List, what to do what not to do !\nDaily Activities - So many of them !\nVehilce Mirror - Perfect Waiting for Things to Be Perfect\nOur next silent killer of productivity is waiting for things to be perfect, you see, unproductive people are great at waiting for the time to be right. They’re great at waiting until they feel like it, waiting until they’re in the mood to get started. The door of opportunity is right there for them to walk through it, but they’re waiting for it to open now. Rarely does the perfect time ever come. So let’s take a look at our rocket right here. Now, with the rocket such as this one, there’s something called escape velocity. Now, a rocket must reach a speed of about seven miles per second to escape the earth’s pull of gravity. But almost all of that energy is needed at the beginning when a rocket first launches. You and I are no different. But the good news is that objects in motion tend to stay in motion and all you need to do to get started is to get started and the rest will usually take care of itself.\nOn the dance floor, you will never be prefect. Enjoy the journey, not destination.\nTree - Multi-Tasking The Myth of Multi-Tasking\nSo this next silent killer of productivity might surprise you is multitasking\nWe’re only able to actually focus deeply on one task at a time. In fact, according to one researcher, instead of making you more productive, multitasking can actually double the amount of time it takes you to complete a specific task while also potentially doubling your mistakes. That’s a pretty significant mental cost. And to make matters worse, when you get distracted. It takes you almost 15 minutes on average to get fully back in the flow\nou’ve got to turn that phone off, shut off your email alerts and put everything else aside. And just by focusing on your most important task, first, by blocking off that time, specifically where all you focus on is that critical task, you’ll see huge results\npath of diminishing returns\nMobile is a big distractor. Follow 1 hour strategy\nFence Wall - Fake Breaks ! Time Leaks \u0026 Fake Breaks\nI am sitting on the Fence Wall, and taking Fake Breaks\nYour brain and your body does need time to rejuvenate and needs breaks in order to perform this optimal level. But these types of activities, surfing the web, checking your email, looking at your Facebook page, these are fake breaks. They don’t actually reset your willpower, reset your focus or help you increase your energy. They’re actually making it worse now\nFence Railing - Emotional ! Poor Emotional and Energy Managment / EE\nIf you are sitting on Fence Railing, it has to be power pose\nAmy Cuddy is a social psychologist and professor at Harvard Business School, delivered a great TED talk that shows the power of influence we have on ourselves and specifically regarding the way that we use our own body. In her studies, she put participants into high powered poses or low power poses for just two minutes now. You’ll see over here on the left, we’ve got our high power poses. This one right here has been dubbed the Wonder Woman Pose. But in each one of these scenarios, you’ll see that they’re making their body wide and or expanding their stance, and over here on the right hand side, you’re going to see low power poses. They’re making themselves small or closing their body language. And after just two minutes, they test the participants hormone levels to see if it had any effect. And quite frankly, I found the findings astounding. Now, those who struck the high power pose, so a 20 percent increase in testosterone and a 25 percent decrease in cortisol, cortisol being a hormone most times associated with stress and those that spent two minutes in the low power poses saw a 10 percent decrease in testosterone and a 15 percent increase in cortisol\nSpeed Limit - Email One of the biggest Silent Killers of Productivity\nVisitor Parking - Time Managment L Shape - Time Managment V/s Self Management (Small L V/s Big L).\nAnd whether we like it or not, each minute is only made up 60 seconds and each week one hundred and sixty eight hours. And those are going to pass us by at the same speed no matter what we do. And in reality, when we’re talking about time management, what we really should be talking about is self-management, because the one and only thing that we have one hundred percent total control over is what we do and how we manage that time. Now, my suggestion is don’t wish you had more time. Instead, wish you had better self-management, better systems, better tactics, better habits, and probably most importantly, better execution on the stuff that you already know how to do and actually put it in a play which you already know you should be doing but aren’t doing. These are the things that really make a difference. And these are the things that you have. One hundred percent total control over time. If you don’t know how to manage yourself, if you don’t know how to set up and actually consistently use the right systems, it wouldn’t matter if you could make more time up here. You wouldn’t be able to fully take advantage of that extra time. So I’m going to encourage you right from the start to instill a new belief. And it’s not about time management. It’s about self management and making the most of the time that you already have. Because if you do make the most of that time that you already do have, you’re going to double and triple the results that you’re getting now.\nStart using in-door cycle and rowing machine, while watching movies\nOverhead Park Fencing / Railing - Spending Time Spending Time vs Investing Time. A big clock hanging, and time is ticking.\nNow, one of the biggest mistakes, I think unhappy, broke and unsuccessful people make is in thinking short term versus long term when making decisions.\nAnd most people, myself included in the past, is typically focused on how they’re spending their time each day instead of focusing on how they’re investing their time\nAnd there’s a huge difference now when most people think of time management productivity, it’s in regards to getting the maximum number of things done in a day, a week or a year. But I’m going to encourage you to look at it from another perspective. When you invest in something, you hope that will give you a return that’s greater than what you invested. For example, if you put five dollars into a stock, you hope to get much more than that, five dollars over time. And I encourage you to look at time the exact same way. Spending your time is about getting things done, investing your time is about setting up systems and delegating tasks that will literally save you hours and create new hours in the future.\nNow, many people won’t take the time to train someone else to do that task or automate that task because it usually requires more effort in the short run.\nMany of the people that I speak with, a lot of them have trouble delegating and letting go. But once you understand the difference between spending your time and getting more time back in the future by investing your time, it becomes a real game changer.\nSo focus more on time investing activities that will pay you back each and every single day and are going to make you more and more productive.\nIdentify tasks where there is scope for investing time\nSpeed Breaker - Sleep The Importance of Sleep to Your Productivity\nAccording to the University of Pennsylvania, if you get six hours of sleep per night for two weeks straight, which is a little less probably than you need, your mental and physical performance declines at the same level as if you stayed awake for 48 hours straight.\nAnother solution can be to take what I call a power nap. And most sleep research will suggest to keep it to less than 30 minutes to keep it from interfering with your normal sleep schedules and circadian rhythms. Even something as small as a 20 minute nap has been proven to improve your memory\nLet power nap be power nap\nGas Bank Door - Water The Healthiest Energy Drink That Most of Us Have Access to For Free!\nWhen your brain is fully hydrated, you think faster, you’re more focused, you have more creativity and more clarity. But most importantly, you’d be more productive. While your brain only makes up about three percent of your body mass, it actually uses up to 20 percent of the water and nutrients that you take in. And just like with sleep deprivation that we just got done talking about, even small amounts of dehydration can lead to big effects. Just one percent of dehydration can lead to a five percent cognitive decline\nIf you’re not sleep deprived and you don’t have as much energy as normal usually is because of dehydration. Start with water and nine times out of ten, that’s going to solve the problem. So I’m going to encourage you to drink water early, drink water often and stay hydrated. You’ll notice the difference and I promise you’ll thank me later\nGas Bank Fire Extinguiser - Energy, Mood, Emotional Mastering Your Energy, Mood \u0026 Emotional State\nYou’ve got two choices. You can direct your attention to those things that are going well, things that are great in your life, things that are where you want them to be, and things that are within your control. And when you do that, how do you feel? You might feel a sense of gratitude, hope, appreciation and progress. But what if you instead choose to focus on what’s missing in your life, what’s going wrong, and focusing on all the things that maybe you’re going wrong in that are missing, that you can’t even control in that instance, how do you feel\nThe tough part is that most of our thoughts and behaviors are habits, the things that we do and thoughts that we think over and over again without even really giving it any conscious thought. So over time, you’ve developed automatic patterns and you habitually lean towards thinking one way or the other\nAnother major contributor to your mood is how you’re using your body at any given moment. As I mentioned in that earlier lecture, studies have shown that something as simple as how you use your body posture and have a hormonal effect specifically as it relates to testosterone and cortisol\nGas Bank Window - Will Power How Will Power Really Works - I can sticker all over the window\nLover’s Point - Knowing and Doing Knowing and Doing Are Completely Different Things\nGive me a mediocre idea that’s flawlessly executed and I will win every single time over a genius idea that never gets off the ground. Now, most people love to put their focus on the latest and greatest thing, the new idea, the sexy idea. But those that execute the fundamentals actually get the best results\nNow, I’m sure you’ve heard the term knowledge is power, but I disagree. I don’t think knowledge really is power. I truly believe that knowledge is potential power, potential power, but only power, if actually acted upon and used that real power comes from its application or execution because without action, there’s no results\nBasketball Board - The Warren Buffet Productivity Secret I think one of the best ways to get better results is to model with the ultra successful people do sustain success is never one hundred percent luck. That just happens to people. Those who are really successful always leave a trail of clues. They simply approach things differently than the rest of us. Now, I mentioned Warren Buffett in a previous lecture and in a previous section, but I want to come back to him one more time. And just as a reminder, he’s worth more than 60 billion dollars, and that’s with a B and as one of the most successful investors of all time. So what’s his secret? His secret is simply saying, no. This is a quote from Mr. Buffett. The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything is sounds too simple, doesn’t it? I mean, we can all pronounce the word no. We all know how to say it, but just about all of us don’t say it enough. Maybe you’re a people pleaser and you want to help others. Or maybe you’re ambitious and want to tackle it all. Or maybe you’re like my wife and you just have foma fear of missing out. Either way, if you’re overwhelmed, this is the place to start. Scott Densmore wrote a great article about a story that he was told to by a friend of his. His friend was a pilot for Warren Buffett at the time. And one day Warren went up to his pilot and jokingly said, the fact that you’re still working for me tells me I’m not doing my job. You should be out there going after more of your goals and dreams were and then asked the pilot to make a list of his top twenty five priorities or goals just to write them all down on a piece of paper. So I threw out a couple of examples right here on this slide to mimic a little bit of what the pilot went through to jot down some of the top priorities and goals that he might have had once the list was complete.\nWarren asked the pilot to review the list and circled the top five that were most important. And those top five, that would make the biggest impact, the ones that he prioritized over everything else. And he insisted he could choose only five\nSo let’s say, for example, that these were the five. That he chose to enroll in school, you know, maybe take the family to Disney World, see lose 20 pounds and create a website. And moved to Texas, who doesn’t want to move to Texas now after these top five were selected, Warren asked him to create a plan for accomplishing all five.\nThere’s nothing earth shattering in this yet, right? Pretty standard stuff. But after they went on to discuss how he was going to accomplish the top five items, Buffett asked the pilot what he planned to do with the remaining 20 items. What are your plans for those? The pilot said, well, those 20 are a close second to my top five, and they’re still very important to me. So I’ll work on them intermittently as I have time while I’m working on my top five items. Wrong answer. Warren said that those other 20 items are now his avoid at all costs list. No matter what, those things get absolutely no attention until he’d succeeded with the other five.\nNow that right there is the magic, the power of focus and saying no and you will hear all the really successful people talk about it. Now, many of us have a to do list, but how many of us have a not to do list? Think about the difference in clarity and focus when you have tunnel vision on your top priorities and nothing else, and this is critical not only for your goals, but for your daily activities as well, potential distractions will only increase with new technology. And as you become more and more successful, those are never going to go away. You will need to become more and more successful and skilled as saying no. So you might as well start exercising that muscle now. So let me ask you. What’s in your top five? I encourage you to perform the exact same exercise using the page and the resources, write down and just get it all on paper, your top twenty five goals and dreams and really sit down and circle the top five. The most critical five is going to give you 80 percent of your results and take you where you want to go.\nI want to improve my DANCE / I want to take my dance to next level.

Batching is simply a type of time management strategy that groups similar tasks that require similar resources together in order to streamline their completion in the most efficient way possible. Now, batching or using theme days minimizes distraction because it keeps your focus narrow. You’re only focused on one item or theme at a time. It also allows you to get into the flow much more easily and be efficient with your resources.\nHarvard Business Review, Peter Bregman notes that our productivity goes down by 40 percent when we try to focus on several things at once. In addition to batching, setting a theme to your day really allows you to make sure that you’re putting in enough time on the important high value activities that are really going to give you your best results.\nBasketball Court Center - Resurrecting Your Dead Time Lately I am watching a lot of movies.

    "content": " What is Emotional Intelligence EQ V/s IQ The EQ Model Your Brain and EQ How to Improve EQ Mistakes to Avoid in Your EQ Development Using EQ to Manage Relationships. Identifying EQ Around You Common signs of low EQ. Examples of the high EQ Using EQ in Daily Life Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5 What is Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize how your emotions are governing your decisions and your thinking. Once you know how emotions affect you, physically and mentally, you are able to learn how to change your reactions. This does not mean changing your emotions or hiding them. What is means is that, you want to identify your emotions and understand why you are feeling a certain way and be more aware of what to do differently and how to do things differently.\nSo bascially, EQ is about identifying how you feel and taking an opportunity to decide how your emotions are helping or hindering you in the work you do and the relationships you have.\nEQ V/s IQ A high IQ doesn’t predict success at work. EQ is a much more reliable indicator of success at work. Whereas People with high EQ are the majority of the top performers. They make better work decisions for themselves, their peers, and their companies. They are well situated to take on exciting opportunities within and outside of their organizations and they make more money than people with low EQ. Executives with high EQ are more likely to succeed than those with high IQ.\nThe EQ Model The concept of emotional intelligence can be broken down into four sections.\nSelf-awareness Your ability to be aware of your feelings in the moment, as they are developing. You feel them and you understand why they are there. It’s about getting to know yourself, listening to yourself, your body, your mind, and your heart. It’s about being self-aware. As your body physically reacts to people and situations, are you feeling the changes?\nSelf-management It involves managing your emotions and the resulting reactions. What you say and do. How well are you managing your emotions? Are you allowing them to drive what you say, think, and do? This isn’t about putting your emotions into a box and sealing it closed. It’s about actively overseeing your reactions.\nSocial awareness It is your ability to recognize and respond to the needs of others. Now some people at work express their needs openly such as I’m frustrated and I need help. Others may not be as explicit with their feelings. You may have to learn how to “read” those people and then to ask questions. People with high social awareness are observing and listening to people. They are empathetic.\nRelationship management It involves considering your emotions as well as those of others as you develop and master relationships. People skilled at Relationship Management build bonds with others. They value teamwork and collaboration, and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nYour Brain and EQ Evolution plays a trick on us humans in such situations because our brains are wired to process and react with big emotions before processing in a logical fashion. In other words you might react emotionally in tiny invisible ways or big bold ways before reacting logically.\nBut research has confirmed that your brain is flexible, malleable and changeable. You can decide to behave more logically rather then being emotionally hijacked. What this means to you is that you can change your behavior, and decide your response in trying and unpleasant circumstance.\nHow to Improve EQ The first and foremost way to increase your EQ you need to learn how to identify the emotions. It begins with understanding how you feel in the grip of emotions. Your body may feel the emotions before you actually “get it”\nLearn Why You Feel It: Once you begin to note how you feel, the second step in self-awareness is to connect the feeling with the reason or cause. Your body might show signs as a result of emotions, even before you realize what’s going on. When you are able to feel a physical sign of it, you will become better at understanding what is happening and why. The people, places, events, times of the day that create a certain emotional reaction. So you’re starting to read your body which is fabulous. Now you need to write down the situations that make you feel one way or another.\nWhat Are Your Buttons?: To change your EQ you need to start with information about the people, places, and times of the day, and so forth, that cause you to respond in ways that are ineffective or unproductive. What pushes your buttons? What provokes you, creates a strong emotional reaction? Is it a silent or covert reaction? You’re fuming on the inside but you’re smiling on the outside. Or, is it a loud one? Having an expression on your face that says it all. Once you identify and become self-aware of your buttons you can begin to manage them, as follows:\nIdentify where in your body you are feeling stress, anxiety, excitement, and so forth. This is the “Feel It” part of the exercise. Next connect the dots by considering the situation you find yourself in when you get sweaty, your mouth is parched, you feel lightheaded, or so forth. This is the “Place It” part of the exercise. These situations are your buttons. Buttons that when they’re pushed, they bother you. Final step, think about and describe why you feel a certain way in a certain situation. The above steps will help you to understand and manage your emotions, and use the emotions in constructive and productive manner.\nMistakes to Avoid in Your EQ Development Becoming too cautious about showing your emotions. They assume that having high EQ means lowering emotional reactions or limiting feelings. That’s false. Remember you are a human, not a robot. Emotions can be managed, not bottled up. Worrying about offending people. EQ leads you to a deeper consideration of what you want to express, with your words, emotions, and actions. Don’t avoid giving solid thoughtful constructive feedback because you are cautious of hurting someone else’s feelings. EQ is the solution to everything. I wish this were the case, but it’s not. EQ isn’t the answer to all of your challenges at work. I’m sure you’re aware of some projects that require hard skills right now, more than soft skills. For example, EQ won’t help you grow your programming skills. So be sure to view your professional development as a balance of hard and soft skills. Failing to ask people to support you. Don’t keep your EQ progress a secret. Remember that emotional intelligence is the leading indicator of success at work. So why not share your interest and ask for support as you build it? Using EQ to Manage Relationships. Relationship management is your understanding of your emotions and how you use that ability to manage interactions with others, in a manner that leads to success for both sides or parties. People skilled at relationship management build bonds with each other. They value teamwork and collaboration and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nIdentifying EQ Around You Social awareness is your ability to observe what others are saying with their words, and with their bodies, and to examine how it affects you.\nSo the first part of strong social awareness involves watching and listening to others. The second part is learning more about the people you work with so you can better understand how to shift your approaches to partnering with them. You learn what people respond to and what they don’t. You learn what they like and what they appreciate and what they don’t enjoy. You don’t need to have a different or unique approach for every single person you work with. You need to start paying more attention to their signals. They are sending them all the time, all day long.\nCommon signs of low EQ. Emotional outbursts. Sudden outbursts that are not a regular occurrence or a trend in this person’s behavior. Passive-aggressive behavior. Someone who is filled with frustration on the inside yet avoids confrontation or honest expression of feelings. Big Reactions. Allowing small things to cause big reactions. Someone who gets stressed easily and can blow some things out of proportion. Failing to ask how others feel. Even when other people show emotions in their faces, their bodies, and in non-verbals. Inability to read social cues from others. Doesn’t take the time to read or pay attention to some signals. Self-centeredness. It’s all about him or her, all the time. Lack of empathy. Someone who is unable to understand and share the emotions of others. Lack of emotion, avoids showing their feelings at any time, stoic. Lack of self-awareness. Someone who doesn’t know his or her buttons, has no idea what sets them off. Blaming others for his or her mistakes. Examples of the high EQ Asking questions for clarity when receiving criticism Listening, 100 percent. And listening, before speaking. The ability to apologize without being nudged to do so Showing passion, frustration, anxiety, the full range of emotions, yet in an appropriate manner. Learning. People with high EQ are looking for ways to improve, to learn. Sharing praise and criticism, openly and with details. Demonstrating empathy. Reading emotions and relating to them. Being assertive but not aggressive. Making mistakes and freely admitting it. Wow, that’s a huge sign of high EQ. Number ten. Valuing the goals of the team and the organization above his or her own. Using EQ in Daily Life The best way to work on EQ is to actually start using it in Daily Life. In this section, I will capture how I have been using EQ in my life, and dealing with emotionally stressful, anxious and stressful situations.\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5 ",

    "content": " Introduction: My Story 1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits Introduction: My Story My Summary\nIf I have to succeed personally, professionally, I have to choose the right habit, and positive thoughts. Everyone has setback in life, but how I choose to deal with it, will decide my future course of action. I always have a choice, to make right choice. With right habits I can succeed in relationships and my profession life as well.\nDespite my lacklustre high school career, I still believed I could become a great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen. The turning point came two years after my injury, when I began college at Denison University. It was a new beginning, and it was the place where I would discover the surprising power of small habits for the first time.\nIn the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my first year.\nA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started.\nBut it was not until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training habits really began to pay off.\nSix years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to the hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team—an honour given to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic honour, the President’s Medal.\nI fulfilled my potential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill your potential as well.\nWe all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.\nIt was a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made progress - the only choice I had - was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began working on this book.\nTo write a great book, you must first become the book\nThe fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and more—have been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently. My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.\nThe backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits - cue, craving, response, and reward - and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps.\nIn total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioural sciences.\nThere is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes the best way I know—an approach that will be effective regardless of where you start or what you’re trying to change. The strategies I cover will be relevant to anyone looking for a step-by-step system for improvement, whether your goals center on health, money, productivity, relationships, or all of the above. As long as human behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.\n1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits 04.Sep.2022\nThis chapter is very intense, very deep and lot of takeaways !!!\n“the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”\nHow does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this approach in your own life?\nIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\nIf you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\nBut when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.\nSimilarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\nThat said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re moving slower than you’d like.\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.\nAre you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.\nTime magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.\nProductivity Compounds: Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.\nDigital Declutter\nStress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”\nNegative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.\nRelationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.\nBamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\nSimilarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.\nThis is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside.\nBut in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.\nYour work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.\nWhen nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.\nForget about goals. Focus on System Instead\nNovember 15, 2021 : Changing job and getting 50% hike is a real life testimony of how the systems work. I kept on learning / working day after day, each day without any specific goal in mind. I just followed a system, and you can see the result yourself Naresh. Wow. It works.\nPrevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set specific, actionable goals.\nEventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.\nGoals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results? I think you would.\nIf you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\nGoals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.\nA handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\nAnd if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.\nThe goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.\nWhat we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\nWhen you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\nJust as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits - a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.\nSmall changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.\nAn atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\nIf you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\n",

Passive reading - to acquire general knowledge Active reading - to scan for solutions Active reading - for deep integration I use mind maps to make connections, and mentally sort my ideas out Build a “mind palace” Simplify and chunk I have learned to be strategic about my reading, and manage my memory. I have developed some key reading, learning and memory recall skills. As for any habit change, the key is to form new habits in place of ineffective ones, and that requires initial practice and conscious effort. The good news is that this is easy to implement.\nMy reading strategy has 3 steps: 1. Scanning the territory I am exploring, and defining my learning needs I always read with a clear purpose in my mind, which primes the brain to identify and prioritise the key ideas, and I only read books that serve my strategic purpose and which capture my interest and energise me. I don’t waste time on poorly written or boring books, I just move on.\nI have a very bad habit i.e. since I started, let me finish it. It is not serving me very well.\n2. Define clear goals before reading every book Set your intention and attention correctly, and you will remember more. Knowing in advance if you are reading to scan for ideas, or to deeply digest content that you know is worth mining for insight, is key. Low productivity is everyone’s enemy, eating up our time unnecessarily.\nThis calls for revision on Pluralsight course, Jason Alba\n3. Use methods that work for me to connect, distill and chunk the key ideas in any book Knowing some memory hacks will help you a great deal here.\nProcess of learning from books Before we start, let’s dispel a myth. When reading non-fiction, you don’t have to read one book at a time. Where did this idea even come from? Reading to learn should be goal-oriented, and it should be fuelled by energy and interest. So let’s unpack the process of learning from books.\nStep 1: Define your reading radar and learning needs The key to remembering the ideas and books that matter, is to deeply integrate the key ideas that are most useful to you. This is stating the obvious, but many people make the mistake of trying to read everything the same way and in the same depth. So by reducing your head clutter, you reduce the cognitive overwhelm that overloads and exhausts your mind.\nSo what does reading strategically mean? By being strategic, you will only study deeply the books (or chapters) that you will benefit from the most.\nI am always scanning Amazon, blogs and other sources of book recommendations. I have a list of topic areas that are of interest to me, and I tell people that I know are knowledgable in these topics. Recommendations or discoveries that hit my radar get a quick scan of reviews on Amazon or Google, followed by a buy or leave decision. If you have Blinkist (a book summary app) then this is a great way to get a fast overview of a book, and short-cut this process. I keep a list of books on my radar, and I regularly review it.\nIf I have 3 or more books on my radar across all topics on my reading map, I will speed read them first (Google “speed read” and you’ll find resources and tips). On first pass I scan the contents pages, read the chapter summaries, and then flick quickly through every page scanning for diagrams, bullet points, and content headings for interesting clues. I will then selectively skim read parts of chapters, to evaluate quality and overlap with other books I’ve scanned.\nStep 2: Define clear goals for reading every book What are my reading goals? If I don’t know, my interest is not peaked my brain is not primed to receive information in the right mode. So I will aimlessly wander into a book and potentially waste time.\nWhen I moved to Spain from the UK, I had to learn the language fast, from scratch. I learned from my language teacher Rocio that there are two types of vocabulary: “passive” and “active.” Passive vocab are all the words that you understand when you hear them, but that you find hard to access when you want to express yourself. These words are on the tip of your tongue, but just beyond your recall. Active vocab is all the vocab you can use when try to express something, without thinking consciously or searching for words. With use, vocab becomes an automatic component of your repertoire for communicating and moves from passive to active.\nIdeas and concepts are committed to memory in a similar way. So I read in one of three learning modes:\nPassive reading - to acquire general knowledge\nI’m reading for the pleasure of learning, and to stay up to speed and hope to stumble on great ideas and tools.\nThe goal for general knowledge reading is simply to enjoy the stimulation of new ideas, without the need to make copious notes or worry about forgetting things. I just accept that general knowledge reading enters into passive memory, and let go of worrying about recall. But if I sat down to recall the key topics and insights of the book, I might struggle.\nActive reading - to scan for solutions\nThe brain will not let go of problems. They circulate round and round in your thoughts. That’s why in GTD (Getting Things Done, the book by David Allen) he tells us for every to-do that we have, we should identify the first thing that needs to be actioned, and then commit when you will do it. Having done this, your brain will let go of worry, knowing that the task is scheduled. If you don’t do this, your mind will be full of worry about all the things that you need to do.\nSolution-seeking is easy because the brain wants to solve your problems. Relevant ideas and tools just jump out at you. The focus of reading is to first understand, and then capture solutions or ideas as they occur to you.\nActive reading - for deep integration\nThis is reading to deeply integrate ideas that are valuable to your career know-how and life goals, and that add to your specialist expertise or professional insights. You want to commit this knowledge to long term “active” memory.\nThese are the books that your first scan suggested are worth deeply reading. Usually I find such books are harder reading material, either because their concepts and ideas are new or challenging to me, or because they are densely packed with research or tightly argued and complex. They demand more time to digest, and are worthy of the investment.\nThese books I will usually read at least twice, and hold for future reference. So my goal is to understand the ideas on the first reading, and capture content to return to. The second reading is to digest, evaluate and decide how to take action on the new knowledge. We want on the second reading to commit the key ideas to long term memory, using all the methods in Step 3.\nStep 3: The right methods to connect, distill and chunk ideas So we’ve identified books that we need to actively capture in longer term memory.\nThe heart of your reading strategy is your choice of methods for digesting and committing to memory what you learn. Note taking is the basic vehicle for most of us (unless you are Dyslexic like Richard Branson, or have a photographic memory like Elon Musk). I use mind maps extensively, plus I capture in the Evernote app all my bullet point summaries of key ideas or quotes and research references.\nI use mind maps to make connections, and mentally sort my ideas out. You can read more how I do this here: Tom Board’s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.\nI use Evernote for word-based note taking, in order to make my reading easily accessible in future, after my memory has faded. I can also structure captured ideas in folders for specific projects or further study. Evernote is fully searchable, even for PDFs and photographed hand-written notes. You can also tag notes, create folders, add web links, record audio, or use a digital pen on the iPad.\nThere are three main memory hacks that I use regularly, depending on the situation:\nBuild a “mind palace”\nThis is an ancient method, which I learned from one of Derren Brown’s short audio books (Memory Tricks I think it was called). It goes like this. Think of a walk that you do often, and know intimately, or a house or other building that you similarly know inside-out. Then mentally associate places or rooms with what you want to remember, in the order you want to remember it.\nEach subject is located in a place on your route, or a room in the building, and you use imagination to associate objects in your memory with the subjects you want to recall. The more outrageous the images, the better for memory recall. Run through mentally the rooms/walk until you can recall these images and subjects reliably. This method is used, I am told, by many TED speakers for presentations. It’s useful if you need to recall information in a certain order, for a well-defined purpose. You can mentally ‘clear’ your walk or palace once an event or situation has passed, and re-programme your mind.\nSimplify and chunk\nSimplification consists of distilling and prioritising what is important, and so de-cluttering the memory of the less important stuff to remember. You can use post-it notes, or just make lists, to sift and prioritise ideas. The ‘expert disease’ is to think that everything is important, and so discard nothing. This just overwhelms your short term memory.\nChunking is a deeper method of ordering information so that you can hold more complex ideas in your short term memory, and think about them. Research shows that you have 3/4 “memory slots” in short term memory. If you try to hold more than 3/4 things in your head at once, you start to struggle. But chunking is a method of hacking this short term memory bottleneck, by grouping ideas. You can read more about chunking in the Quora post here: Tom Board’s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.\nFind helpful metaphors\nOur minds think in metaphors. Metaphors can be simple and generic like “up” or “down” or broad like “country” or specific like “the genome project” or “waste basket” as in the Apple desktop or the physical bin in your office or study. You can associate metaphors with new ideas or concepts, to make them easier to recall. If I say to myself that Malcolm Gladwell’s book Tipping Point “is like the moment I realise I’ve eaten too much and my body diverts all its energy and resources to digestion, and my thinking goes fuzzy as my head feels lighter” then I’ve likened it to a physical body metaphor. If that metaphor is meaningful to me, it will be memorable. Taking this further, if I want to convey ideas in a way that others will remember them, then I should choose familiar and universal metaphors to liken them too. Marketers use this trick all the time to introduce new products and services without triggering consumer’s resistance to change and newness. So in summary, maintain a map of your reading territory consisting of the topics of interest and all the books on your radar. Speed read or scan them, or use a book summary service, to prioritise your reading. Then selectively read deeply, and throw all the memory tricks here at the key books so that you can access the knowledge you need, when you need it.\nI would like to end on a simple idea that helps tremendously: be selective, and let go of guilt. Don’t treat reading books like a challenge that must be overcome. Reframe your reading as meeting different goals, and take pleasure and time to read the books that really matter. You will have less mental clutter, more time, and enjoy the process far more. Best of luck.\n",

It is time to create new behaviors and habits oriented away from sabotage and toward success . It’s that simple .\nChapter 1: The Compound Effect In Action It doesn’t matter how smart you are or aren’t , you need to make up in hard work what you lack in experience , skill , intelligence , or innate ability . If your competitor is smarter , more talented , or experienced , you simply need to work three or four times as hard .\nIf you aren’t good at something, work harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too.\nChapter 2: Choices It’s the little things in life that will bite you .\nI have not been any more lucky or unlucky than anyone else . The difference is when luck came my way, I took advantage of it.\nThe ( Complete ) Formula for Getting Lucky : Preparation (personal growth) + Attitude (belief / mindset) + Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) + Action (doing something about it) = Luck\nAttitude : This is where luck evades most people , and where Sir Richard is spot - on with his belief that luck is all around us. It’s simply a matter of seeing situations , conversations, and circumstances as fortuitous . You cannot see what you don’t look for, and you cannot look for what you don’t believe in.\nSo no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the great defeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. Countless people have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you , and yet they’re wealthier and more fulfilled. Luck is an equal - opportunity distributor . Lady luck shines on all , but rather than having your umbrella overhead , you’ve got to have your face to the sky When it comes down to it, it’s all you, baby. There’s no other way around it.\nWhen I learned of the wrongdoings, I chose not to lose any more time fighting it. Instead, I licked my wounds, learned my lesson, and moved on. In hindsight, I’d make the same choice to pick up and move on again today .\nI now challenge you to do the same. No matter what has happened to you, take complete responsibility for it — good or bad, victory or defeat. Own it. My mentor Jim Rohn said, “The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life.”\nTracking Exercise\nKeep Track of your workout details\nThis tracking exercise changed my awareness of how I related to my money. It worked so well, in fact, that I’ve used it many times to change other behaviors. Tracking is my go - to transformation model for everything that ails me. Over the years I’ve tracked what I eat and drink, how much I exercise, how much time I spend improving a skill, my number of sales calls, even the improvement of my relationships with family, friends, or my spouse. The results have been no less profound than my money - tracking wake - up call . After hundreds of tournaments played and thousands of strokes tallied , the difference between the No . 1 – ranked golfer and the No . 10 golfer is an average of 0.32 strokes, but the difference in prize money is more than double ( $ 9.6 million versus $ 4.6 million ) ! The No. 1 golfer isn’t five times better, not even 50 percent or 10 percent better . In fact, his average score is only 0.5 percent better. Yet the results are more than double !\nEven though you saved for many more years and invested much more cash, you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could have had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate and neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. Don’t wait another day to start the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals!\nThe key is to start NOW. Every great act , every fantastic adventure , starts with small steps . The first step always looks harder than it actually is .\nChapter 3: Habits “My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life !” the teacher exclaimed. “The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to even try.”\nFrom what we’ve already discussed , you know successful people aren’t necessarily more intelligent or more talented than anyone else. But their habits take them in the direction of becoming more informed, more knowledgeable, more competent, better skilled, and better prepared.\nLike Larry Bird, you can condition your automatic and unconscious responses to be those of a developed champion . This chapter is about choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits. It’s about becoming a creature of champion habits .\nForget about willpower. It’s time for why - power. Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams. The wisest and most motivating choices are the ones aligned with that which you identify as your purpose, your core self, and your highest values. You’ve got to want something, and know why you want it , or you’ll end up giving up too easily.\nWell said. That’s why it’s not enough to choose to be successful. You have to dig deeper than that to find your core motivation, to activate your superpower. Your why - power .\nWe can all make powerful choices . We can all take back control by not blaming chance, fate, or anyone else for our outcomes. It’s within our ability to create change. Rather than letting past hurtful experiences sap our energy and sabotage our success, we can use them to fuel positive, constructive change.\nWhen you define your goals , you give your brain something new to look for and focus on. It’s as if you’re giving your mind a new set of eyes through which to see all the people , circumstances, conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you. With this new perspective(an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside — your goal. It’s that simple. The difference in how you experience the world and draw ideas, people, and opportunities into your life after you have clearly defined your goals is profound. In one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way : “Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy. And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting blanks without written goals — and that’s the starting point.”\nI suggest that you take some time today to make a list of your most important goals. I recommend considering goals in all aspects of your life, not just for your business or finances. Be wary of the high price of putting too much focus on any single aspect of your life, to the exclusion of everything else. Go for whole - life success — balance in all the aspects of life that are important to you: business, finances, health and well - being, spirituality, family and relationships, and lifestyle.\nWhen most people set out to achieve new goals, they ask, “Okay , I have my goal; now what do I need to do to get it? ” It’s not a bad question, but it’s not the first question that needs to be addressed either. The question we should be asking ourselves is : “Who do I need to become?” You probably know some people who seem to do everything right, but still don’t produce the results they want, right? Why not ? One principle Jim Rohn taught me is : “If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.”\nChapter 4: Momentum But you set yourself up for failure by doing too much too soon. Chapter 5: Influences As you might guess, I don’t watch or listen to any news and I don’t read any news feeds or news publications. Ninety - nine percent of all news has no bearing on my personal life or my personal goals, dreams, and ambitions anyway. I have set up a few RSS feeds identifying the news and industry updates that do pertain to my direct interests and goals. The news that’s helpful to me gets plucked out of the fray so I don’t have to get any mud slung into my glass of water. While most people wade through hours of irrelevant garbage that hampers their thinking and crushes their spirit, I get the most productive information I need when I need it, in less than fifteen minutes a day.\nI once had a neighbor who was deemed a three - minute friend . For three minutes, we could have a great chit - chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. I can hang out with an old high - school friend for three hours, but he’s not a three - day guy And, then there are some people I can hang around for a few days, but wouldn’t go on an extended vacation with. Take a look at your relationships. Make sure you’re not spending three hours with a three - minute person.\nYou, too , can have almost any mentor you want, if he or she has gathered their best thoughts, stories, and ideas into books, videos, and podcasts . You have an unlimited bounty from which to draw. Take advantage of it. Now people often reach out to my assistant in order to get my advice or mentorship. All she has to do is tell them it’s all already available from anywhere in the world through DarrenDaily or inside our Darren Hardy Training Vault.\nTechnical Skills: Sergey Kargopolov, Stephane Marek\nSoft Skills: Dan Appleman, Josh Paulsen, Jonathan Levi, Jarad Hill\nIf you want to have a better, deeper, more meaningful relationship, ask yourself, “Who has the type of relationship I want? How can I spend (more) time with that person? Who can I meet who can positively influence me?” Let their glow rub off on you. Befriend the person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful person in your field. What do they read? Where do they go for lunch? How can that association influence you? You can build these expanded associations by joining networking groups and even online communities. Find the charity organizations, symphonies, and clubs where the people you want to emulate gather.\nYou’re never too good for a mentor . My friend Harvey Mackay told me , “I have had twenty coaches, if you can believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, I have a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” I have always found it interesting that the most successful people , the truly top performers , are the ones willing to hire and pay for the best coaches and trainers there are. It pays to invest in your improved performance.\nPut another way, you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of.\nIt’s amazing how life will organize around the standards you set for yourself. Some people think they’re the victims of other people’s behavior, but in actuality, we have control over how people treat us. Protect your emotional, mental, and physical space. Then you can live with peace, rather than in the chaos and stress the world will hurl upon you.\nChapter 6: Acceleration But instead of quitting, every time I hit one of those mental and emotional walls, I recognized my competitors were facing the same challenges. I knew this was another moment when, if I kept going, I would gain strides ahead of them. These were the defining moments of success and progress. It wasn’t difficult, painful, or challenging when I was just running with the herd, just keeping up, but not really getting ahead. It’s not getting to the wall that counts. It’s what you do after you hit it that really matters.\nIt’s the extra effort after you have done your best that is the difference - maker. His team went on to win the game in the second half. That is how you win.\nWhen conditions are great, things are easy, there aren’t any distractions, no one is interrupting, temptations aren’t luring, and nothing is disturbing your stride. It’s not until situations are difficult, when problems come up and temptation is great, that you get to prove your worthiness for progress. As Jim Rohn would say , “Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better.”\nWhen you hit the wall in your disciplines, routines, rhythms, and consistency, realize that’s when you are separating yourself from your old self, scaling that wall and finding your more powerful, triumphant, and victorious self.\nYouTube ",

Meet the Spring Family\nThe Spring family all began with the creation of the Spring Framework, which was built largely in response to the complexity of developing applications using Java’s enterprise framework called J2EE, it’s now called Java EE, and the Spring Framework aimed at removing the complexity and helped to make things like web development and data access easier for developers to implement. It also aimed at reducing boilerplate code, and if you’re not familiar with what that is, it’s repetitive code that’s often needed as part of the logic, but tends to clutter the application and draw focus away from the main logic. The Spring Framework is still heavily used today, and it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. The success of the Spring Framework led to the creation of several Spring projects that were built on top of the Spring Framework, but tailored to specific needs or domains. For example, the Spring Security project was created to remove the complexity and challenges with securing a Java application, and another project, like the Spring Data project, was created to further simplify data access in Java applications. The Spring Framework and Spring projects continued to evolve and thrive, eventually resulting in the creation of a particularly impactful project called Spring Boot. Spring Boot was a real game changer. It provided a new and drastically faster way of building Spring-based applications. Up until Spring Boot, building a Spring-based application had always involved a lot of choice making, configuration, and a cumbersome deployment model. Spring Boot removed all of that by taking an opinionated view of building Spring-based applications including sensible defaults for library choices and configuration, and adding smarts for auto-detecting and auto-configuring other common configurations. It also massively simplified the deployment process and made running a Spring-based application as simple as running a single command. Lastly came the Spring Cloud project. Spring Cloud was built on top of Spring Boot and simplified the development of applications that make use of distributed architectures, such as microservice architectures, and these type of architectures often have many common patterns that are implemented, such as service discovery and distributed configuration, and Spring Cloud helped to make it easier for developers to build applications that use those patterns. Now that we’ve been introduced to the Spring family, let’s take a look at why we would want to use it.\nWhy Spring?\nSo why Spring? And oftentimes you’ll hear people asking, why would I want to use Spring? And that’s probably something you may be even thinking for yourself right now. And one of the common answers you’ll hear is that it’s a good alternative to Java EE, and while that was true in the beginning, today Spring is so much more than just an alternative to Java EE. In fact, it’s actually complimentary to Java EE and makes use of several of the standard specifications like the Java Persistence API. The question of why you would want to use Spring is a completely valid and reasonable question that actually has a very simple answer, and that’s that creating software can be hard, seriously, and Spring helps make it easier. You’ll notice that regardless of the project within the Spring family, they all share a common theme, and that’s to make developing Java applications easier. Let’s talk about some other reasons why Spring is a good choice. First, Spring is really great at being flexible, modular, and especially backwards compatible. So Spring is far from an all‑or‑nothing type of choice. In fact, you’re given the freedom to pick and choose whichever parts of Spring make the most sense for your project. And what’s really great about that is that you can be sure that the investment you’re making with Spring won’t be wasted when a new version is released. Spring also has a very large and active community, and in my opinion this is often one of the things that’s overlooked and taken for granted when assessing technologies, but it makes a huge difference. With Spring, you can be sure that there’s a wealth of knowledge that already exists out there, and if you run into a problem, it’s likely that someone else has already ran into that same problem, and they can probably help you through it. And lastly, what makes Spring a good choice is that it’s continually innovating and evolving. Being an open‑source project but fully backed by a company called Pivotal allows Spring to remain healthy and alive, while at the same time pushing the bounds of enterprise Java development. It’s not uncommon for Java’s standards or specifications to be influenced or based on ideas that originated within Spring.\n",

    "content": "Why Python? Simple to Learn\nPython is very simple to learn. Very minimal computer knowledge is required to learn and use Python. You don’t need to know the difference between computer memory and a hard drive, you don’t need to know what an operating system is, you don’t need to know what a compiler is, nor do you need to know about build systems, and you don’t need to learn any other programming languages first. Whether you’re new to computers or not, you can learn Python. Python is also built with a goal to be easy to read and understand.\nSimple to Use\nThere are several core tenets of the Python programming language that makes it simple to use. One of the first tenants contributing to Python’s ease of use is that there is usually only one way to do things. Some programming languages believe strongly in flexibility, that the developers should be able to solve a given problem in many different ways. Python is not one of these languages. Being able to solve a single problem many ways is like having a large box of building blocks without any instruction book, or it can be like sitting in front of a blank canvas and being able to paint anything you want. At times, this feeling can be very freeing. When you are first using a programming language, though, constraints are very good to have. They provide guardrails that helped guide you to a likely solution. The constraints help point you in a direction that will help you maintain your forward momentum. This single way to accomplish a task also translates to Python’s next tenant. Python focuses on simplicity. That simplicity translates to ease of use. Excess complexity introduces confusion. Let’s say you were wanting to learn to use a new device. If there are lots of knobs to turn, levers to pull, and buttons to push, it can be difficult to figure out how to use that device, but with a simplified and intuitive interface, what needs to be done becomes clear and more obvious. That’s why a language that focuses on simplicity like Python is simple to use as well. Finally, Python and its community encourages beautiful code. The focus on beauty makes it a more pleasurable experience to use. When you don’t enjoy using something, it makes it more difficult to continue using that thing. If something brings you joy, though, it increases your desire to continue using it. The Python community has come to embrace this principle when building Python features. For these reasons, and more we’ll investigate in our next module, Python is a programming language that is simple to use.\nGreat Community\nA large contributing factor to Python being simple to learn and use is thanks to support from Python’s great community. The Python community has driven many core principles into Python, which has helped it become what it is today. The community involvement can be seen directly in how Python is supported and how Python is developed as a language. The community provides great support for developing Python code. You can see this in the countless third‑party Python packages and code libraries that are available, the great third‑party tools that can be used when using Python, and much more. We will take a closer look at these later in this course. Python’s development is also conducted largely through community‑driven proposals called Python Enhancement Proposals, also known as PEPs. This process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding proposals are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community. This has enabled Python to evolve as a shared language and evolved to user’s changing needs over the many years. Many of the principles we’ve already covered in this course were arrived at as part of this process.\nHigh Demand Python continues to grow in popularity, and the ability to work with Python is a skill that’s increasing in demand in the industry. In even the recent past, when many developers thought of popular programming languages, they tended to think of Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, and perhaps even PHP. Python didn’t usually come to mind. But according to some recent Stack Overflow analysis, Python has now overtaken other languages like Java, C#, and C++ based on Stack Overflow question views. And according to PYPL, the PopularitY of Programming Language Index, Python is now the most popular programming language, with its popularity continuing to grow each year. And it doesn’t stop there. Python has the highest spectrum rating according to the recent IEEE Spectrum report, and the TIOBE index now has Python in the top three of programming languages worldwide. All this to say, there’s really no longer any denying that Python is a popular programming language and a great language to invest your time into learning.\nWidely Used Over its many years of usage, Python has continued to grow and has become increasingly powerful and capable. Python has been used anywhere from special effects in movies like Star Wars to application scripting support in the popular open source, 3D modeling application, Blender. Four areas I’ll highlight where Python has seen widespread use are web development, data science, education and learning, and scripting. As we briefly discuss each, it’s okay if you don’t understand what each area is or how Python is used within it. With these examples, I’m just aiming to emphasize that Python is widely used in many different areas.\nWeb Development The first area we’ll discuss where Python has seen growing use is in the area of web development. There are many different buckets or styles of web development. You might be developing just an HTTP or REST API and, hence, not dealing with front‑end user interfaces, just back‑end service code. Or, you might be building a full‑stack web application that touches both the client and the server. You might even be working with an out‑of‑the‑box content management system application, ERP application or an application of a different flavor. No matter which it is, though, there’s a Python solution out there for you. If you’re building APIs, you can find existing popular Python frameworks like Flask, Bottle, Pyramid or a myriad of others. And the same goes with full‑stack web development. You have popular frameworks like Django, TurboGears, web2py, and many others at your disposal. And for the full, self‑contained web applications, you can find apps like Plone, django CMS, Mezzanine, and more. Basically, no matter what type of web application you’re developing, Python is being used out there today and can likely meet your needs too.\nData Science Data science is a field that is growing in popularity with each passing week. Data science itself is an exceptionally large field. Two common areas that tend to be wrapped up in the data science field are those of big data and machine learning. Let’s take a quick look at both of them. So what is big data? As developers, we’re used to thinking of data in terms of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, but data is growing rapidly. More and more systems are needing engineers to start thinking in the terms of terabytes, petabytes or, in some cases, even exabytes. Yes, exabytes. The amount of data being generated each day is growing rapidly and shows no signs of stopping. As of 2012, 2.4 EB of new data were generated every single day. To put that in perspective, that is 2.5, followed by 18 zeros. Datasets have grown so large that existing data processing systems are unable to deal with them. New systems are needed. This is where the growing popularity of technologies like Hadoop and MapReduce are coming from. What used to be a problem faced primarily by large companies like Google or Microsoft is now starting to be faced by smaller enterprise businesses. The more data we have available to us, the more we can spot new business trends, find correlations to help prevent new diseases, combat crime, and so on. And Python is a popular programming language used in this space. Now, machine learning is not directly related to big data; however, the more data we have available to us, the more powerful machine learning becomes. So what is machine learning? Today we are surrounded by data everywhere. It comes in all forms, shapes, and sizes. It might come from large text files, or it might be generated by the actions of users. It may be the large amount of metadata available in pictures and videos, or it might be networks and graphs of relationships people have with each other. The many relationships that might exist between all this data is potentially much more complex than any single person or group of people could find. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack. So instead, algorithms are written in such a way that a computer can process all the data and find its own connections between the many different sources. Machine learning is now commonly used in several different places. It can be used to help determine whether a given piece of email is spam or not, it can be used to help detect possible network intrusions by using the vast amount of network traffic to detect what is abnormal or not, it’s used for optical character recognition to convert images of text into text data that a computer can understand and process, or it can be used for computer vision problems like face detection, object tracking, and motion tracking, and new uses for machine learning are being discovered every day.\nEducation and Learning Python is widely used in education and learning, and its popularity continues to grow in the field. Python is getting wider adoption as a language to use when teaching basic STEM skills to younger students across the world. It’s also being used as a first programming language in which to teach people programming in the first place. This usage is not just for younger students either, as Python is becoming more popular as a language to teach programming in college courses around the world as well. Python is being used as an education tool to teach people more about computing hardware as well via accessible maker devices like the Raspberry Pi and the micro:bit. Another great way Python is used in education is via Jupyter Notebooks. Sometimes the best way to learn is through interaction and exploration of what code does and the consequences of changing a given piece of code. Jupyter Notebooks, a project that grew out of the interactive Python interpreter IPython are a great way to share different topics with people and to encourage people to explore a given topic in an interactive way that can be changed in code. Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity lately, especially in the data science space, and is pushing forward the concept of interactive education, especially in computer programming.\nScripting One of the most common uses of scripting with Python is to perform administration of computers When writing scripts to administer a machine, it’s routine to work with folders and files on the machine, perhaps managing a series of log files or examining and monitoring the file system. Or we might be dealing with the configuration of apps and services. We can monitor the processes running on a system, keeping an eye on any potential runaway processes that need to be kept in check. We may even deploy a new application, deploy new versions of an existing application or remove older applications that are no longer used. Python supports performing any of these tasks. The main limit is our imagination. We have full access to the wide variety of Python libraries that are already out there or that we are creating from scratch. The last area we’ll discuss is application scripting. One way to think of application scripting is to think about how we typically think of an application itself. As a user, we typically don’t think of an application as something that can be easily extended by us. The application is exactly what we’re given, no more, no less. But what if a user or developer could write their own code to respond to events that are raised within the application, or, going even further, what if a developer could write their own user interface elements, new screens, new user flows or something else and integrate it directly into the application itself? Not many applications written today take advantage of how powerful a concept this is. Games are one type of application that this is more common, but it’s less common to find this in your typical application outside of that area. But this is exactly what application scripting aims to do, and is one area Python can be used to a powerful degree. You can find it in 2D and 3D modeling software, image manipulation software in the form of different image processing algorithms, photo taking applications in the form of fun overlays over pictures, and other types of applications as well.\n",
