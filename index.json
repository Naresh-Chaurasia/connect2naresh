    "content": " Consumers of Microservices API What is API Management How does API Management Work API management control Consumers of Microservices API Microservices API are consumed by 3 types of consumers, these being private or internal API consumer, public or external consumers, partner API. So depending on the consumer of the API and API is marked as private, public or partner API.\nPrivate or Internal API consumer\nThe Private or Internal API consumer are microservices that are built by team(s), which are in similar organization.\nPublic or External consumers\nThese are the independent developers outside the organization. These developers invoke the publicly exposed APIs.\nPartner API\nIt may be the resellers or the affiliate.\nWhat is API Management From the developer’s / implementation perspective, there is no difference between the three types of APIs. The difference is in how these apps are managed.\nFor example, the private API consumer may be able to invoke the API 5000 times per second, whereas the public API consumers will be allowed to invoke the same API five times per second.\nAnother example is where the private API consumer may be allowed to access all of the API features, whereas the public API consumer will be restricted only to certain get calls on the API.\nThe above aspects of an API are managed outside of the micro services implementation by way of API management platform. API management platform is a technology that is used for addressing the Common API concerns, like access and authorization of APIs, logging and analytics, Quotas (consumer is allowed to access the API 5000 times per second or five times per second), and API documentation which provides information to the consumers on how to use the apps.\nHow does API Management Work Micro services expose their APIs by way of these API management platforms. The API management platform exposes the APIs by way of a proxy point. The consumers of the API invoke the API by way of the proxy endpoint. They never connect directly to the API exposed by the micro service where the consumer invokes the API. The API management platform applies the management control and based on the outcome of those controls, the EPA management platform either allows the invocation of the EPA on the micro servers or it denies the request for invocation.\nAPI management control Most API management platform offers are declarative or policy based management features. What that means is that the developer of the micro servers doesn’t have to code any of these management controls. They can simply put together policies for defining these controls. For example, a policy may be defined for the internal or private consumer to be such that maximum flexibility is provided to the consumer. So in other words, most of their calls will go through.\nFor the public domain developers, yhe policy may be extremely restricted for the partnerships. The policy may be such that it define some kind of SLA.\nNow, if you’re wondering how these policies are defined, these policy definition mechanism is totally dependent on the API management product. JSON is commonly used for defining these policies. So if you’re interested in knowing more about how these policies are defined, you’ll have to pick up one of the API management products, such as apigee, Mulesoft, WSO2 to understand the nature of these policy documents.\nMost cloud vendors today also offer API management services like the Amazon API Gateway and the Azure API management. If you’re not using an API management platform, I highly recommend that you look at the possibility of adopting an API management solution.\nAlthough there are multiple benefits of using an API management platform from the micro services development team perspective. The biggest benefit is that the team can focus on the domain or the business logic rather than spending time on common concerns such as security, logging, etc..\nAs a result, the micro services source code is cleaner. Last but not the least, since the consumers of the EPA do not connect directly to the Microsoft service, change management become easier. So what that means is that the microservices development team can make the changes to the API and adjust the proxy on the API management platform to insulate the end consumer from those changes.\n",

Your palms should be facing forward.\nSlowly bend your elbows until they are at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms are parallel to the ground.\nPush the weights up by straightening your arms.\nAs you push the weights up, move your arms in an arc to bring the dumbbells together, until they meet over the center of your chest. Hold for a count of one.\nLower the dumbbells by slowly bending your elbows back to 90 degrees.\nContinue lowering your arms until they are a little lower than parallel to the floor. (Your elbows should be pointing slightly towards the floor and you should feel a stretch in your chest muscles and shoulders.)\nRepeat\nFlat Bench Barbell Press Feet should be wide apart and flat on the floor (unless the program tells you otherwise) to give your upper body muscles a solid platform from which they can generate power.\nKeep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the exercise. Pull them together before you lower the bar, and keep them together as you lift.\nA grip slightly wider than shoulder width will assure maximum effort from all areas of the chest.\nStabilize by ensuring that your shoulders, head, and hips remain in contact with the bench at all times.\nKeeping your elbow out will ensure you are using more chest and less triceps.\nDo not bounce the bar off your chest or arch your back – this reduces the amount of chest work and risks injury to the chest muscles. You may arch your back (which provides greater power) to complete a set, but only if you have difficulty with the last repeat and you do not have the help of a fellow athlete.\nKeep a firm grip on the bar with your forearms approximately perpendicular to the floor and parallel to each other.\nAvoid dropping the weight quickly.\nIt’s a very good idea to have a spotter on hand who can help lift the bar off your chest if you unexpectedly fail to complete a repetition.\nDecline Dumbbell Bench Press Make sure that your legs are steady at the top of the bench—you don’t want to slide down the bench.\nUse light weight in the beginning, raising and lowering the dumbbells directly over your lower chest.\nForcefully press the dumbbells up in an arc (coming toward each other at the top) until your arms are fully extended above your lower chest or upper abs.\nYour breathing should always be out on extension, which means you are blowing the weight away.\nDon’t bounce the dumbbells at the bottom of the movement.\nFlare your elbows out as the bar is lowered to maximize pectoral isolation.\nIt is not advisable to work out intensely for prolonged periods with the head below the level of the heart. This is because the human body is not designed for effort in an inverted posture.\nThe bench should never be set at a decline of more than about 35 degrees.\nDecline Barbell Bench Slowly lower the resistance to your collarbone, making a conscious effort to keep your elbows wide. To stretch the chest muscles at the bottom of the movement and work your pectoralis muscle harder, spread your elbows as far from your body as possible and use a pronated grip (thumbs facing each other).\nThe weights should travel perpendicular to the floor.\nTo keep your body stable during the exercise, your knees should be at the end of the bench with your lower legs hanging over the end. There should be a support bar to press your feet against for further stability and to keep you from sliding down.\nDo not lift your head up and do not bridge or arch.\nThe lower pectoral is best targeted at a decline of 20 to 40 degrees to the floor. Steeper declines shift the focus from the chest to the triceps.\nThe greater the decline angle, the more weight you’ll be able to use (to a point) due to the decreasing range of motion.\nHave your partner assist by giving you two forced repetitions or two negative repetitions.\nIncline Dumbbell Bench Press Make sure that you raise and lower the weights evenly. Avoid jerking or twisting your body to “muscle” them upwards.\nKeep your back pressed against the bench, your feet flat on the floor.\nThe path the dumbbells travel when performing this exercise is important. When lowering the dumbbells, be sure the initial movement is out and away from your chest rather than straight down. The dumbbells should not hit your chest at the bottom. They should be even and a couple of inches away from the outside part of your chest. Push the dumbbells through the same path on the way up as on the way down.\nThe lower the dumbbells descend, the more the chest muscle stretches. Lowering the dumbbells too far can cause shoulder injury; it is safer to terminate the descent when the dumbbells reach chest level. You should achieve a maximal but comfortable stretch.\nKeep your forearms vertical under the weights. They should move perpendicular to the ground and parallel to each other.\nFlare your elbows out wide during descent. Keeping your elbow out will ensure you are using more chest and less triceps.\nIf you are new to this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. The spotter assists by spotting your forearms near your wrists.\nDo not set the angle of the bench too high otherwise the anterior deltoids will be targeted and take much of the emphasis away from the chest.\nButterflies / Pec Deck / Seated Machine Flyes Sit on a pec deck machine with your back flat against the back rest.\nGrip the handles and make sure your arms are parallel to the floor. If not parallel,adjust the seat or handles accordingly. This is the start position.\nExhale and slowly push the handles together squeezing your chest to the middle as you do so. Hold for a count of one.\nInhale as you return to the starting position in a controlled movement.\nRepeat.\nReferences https://www.anywherefitness.ie/blog/19-variations-of-the-chest-press-exercise https://workoutlabs.com/exercise-guide/dumbbell-bench-press/ https://bodybuilding-wizard.com/flat-barbell-bench-press/ ",

One was my family. One was my job. And most importantly, was my part time business. And I think the part time business is the most sort of important thing, because it was the only way that I could get out of the financial rut that I was in.\nFence Railing - compartmentalization technique So what then happened was I dedicated two hours a day to the part time business using what we call a compartmentalization technique\nFence Pillar - Where You Are Standing in pillar with telescope and watching how far is my goal 3rd and 4th is covered in MAAP firstly, knowing where you are and where you want to be, this is a pretty obvious statement and you might be thinking, I know where I am in life, but you’ll be surprised that the vast majority of people don’t know where they are in life. They don’t know how far away they are from achieving their goals, if they have any in the first place. They also don’t know what their purpose is. You may be one of them.\nThe second aspect is how you plan to bridge that gap and achieve your goals, planning is a fundamental process that one has to do in order to achieve the goals.\nThe third aspect is how you train your mind to achieve your goals. I have mentioned before that mindset required for achieving success is one of the most crucial factors.\nAnd the fourth aspect is how you everything action is usually what separates a person from achieving anything in life, massive, determined and consistent action is the name of the game.\nThere is a saying that I have always lived by, and it was taught to me by one of my mentors. And and the same goes as follows. Thoughts will determine what you want, but action ultimately determines what you get. We will delve deeper into these four aspects in the chapters to follow.\nGreen Bench - MAAP Technique Sitting on bench and drawing a MAAP The M stands for mindset, as mentioned before, mindset is a key component that I have highlighted already.\nThe A stands for awareness awareness is knowing exactly what you want out of life, and again, I have spoken about this in detail previously.\nThe A stands for action, so these are the small, incremental actions that you need to do on a daily basis, actions that are in line with your goals.\nAnd finally, the P, which stands for Planning, and again, as highlighted previously, what planning is required to achieve your goals?\nPark 2 Pillar - Awareness When I look at the Pillar, there is images of me looking back.\nSo awareness, as mentioned before, is knowing exactly what you want out of life. And not only that, knowing where you stand currently is also part of that awareness.\nI don’t mean anything materialistic, like a new car, a new house or any other materialistic things, I mean something that’s deeper. And I need you to think long and hard about it. I want you to write. The first few things that actually popped into your mind, and that’s where you write it in this section. So just take time out, pause this video and just do a little bit of brainstorming and what you actually want out of life.\nWhy do you want what you said you want?\nPark 2 Overhead Railing - Mission Statement So most organizations have this mission statement, which is basically a statement that best describes an organization’s key purpose and value and what it is committed to doing.\nSimilarly, you yourself should have a mission statement that clearly describes what you feel like. Your purpose in life is it clearly separates what’s important and what’s not in your life. And it also describes your values.\nPark 1 Overhead Lamp - SMART Specific\nAn example of a broad term goal is a goal such as I would like more money in my life or I would like a promotion at work.\nI would like to earn ten thousand dollars more this year than last year. I would like to be promoted to the position of general manager. The M stands for measurable, your goals should have some form of monitoring or tracking. So in other words, you should be able to know how far you are away from achieving your goals, whether you’re on track and ultimately finding out when you have finally achieved your goals.\nThe A stands for achievable. So, in other words, how realistic are your goals? Are you able to accomplish it based on your current constraints, such as financial factors or time constraints or resource constraints? Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, I will go back to the example of wanting a promotion at work. You may you may need to step back and ask yourself questions such as do you have the right qualifications or experience to suit that role? If you don’t, then maybe setting another goal, such as developing the experience and qualifications necessary to get that promotion before you actually set the goal of getting a promotion.\nAlso to highlight the example of, for example, wanting more money, you may need to step back and ask yourself, how will you get more money? You won’t get more money by doing the same thing that you’re doing now. So you may need to re-evaluate your goal and change it to having a goal of developing, for example, a second stream of income. That would be a goal prior to having more money.\nThe R stands for relevant, this means that the goal that you have sent have said should be worthwhile and full of meaning to you. Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, if you would like a promotion at work and your overall goal is to be financially free, then is it worth gaining that extra qualification that you need for gaining that experience? Or should you utilize your time in developing another stream of income? Those are the types of questions that you need to ask yourself.\nThe T stands for time based, you need to set a date or some sort of timeline to achieve your goal. It is absolutely critical to assign this date, this deadline date, as mentally you are now under a deadline to achieve that goal.\nGarden 1 Drainage Pipeline If I don’t take care of my goals, they will go down the Drainage\nadventure goals family goals / relationship goals financial goals health goals the next stage is to determine which goals are short term, medium term or long term. It’s time to be realistic at this stage, not all goals can be short term\nPenguin Dustbin - Choose at least five The first step in this is to choose at least five to seven short term goals that you feel are priority for each category. Now, the amount of goals that you choose is entirely up to you. You can choose less or more. The important thing here is that it should be comfortable for you and not too overwhelming and at the same time, not too less.\nThe question here is, how relevant is your goal to your overall mission statement? Is it worthwhile? And is this what you really want in life? And time bound now.\nmake it more smarter, the more smarter your goals, the more specific, the more measurable, the more achievable, the more relevant. And the more time bound they are, the higher your chance of actually achieving your goals\nTrees / Forest - Time And when I do this exercise, it brings into perspective that, yes, they do have time. It’s just how that time is managed and how you how you spend that time\nBench Green Red - Compound Effect So another example is simply reading, for example, 10 pages of a good book every day will equate to reading approximately 10 to 15 books a year\nThen the key to becoming good at them is to know more than what 95 percent of the population know. And the best way to do this is to read books on that particular topic. So, again, if you read an average of 10 to 15 books on a particular topic, then you automatically become an expert in that field. So that’s just food for thought. The reason I’m saying this is that every action that you take towards your goals, no matter how small or trivial they seem, will eventually add up to a bigger result, provided that you remain consistent and determined and that the action is in the right direction\nSpeed Breaker - compartmentalization technique But for now, just think of which colors that you want to assign to each of your goal categories\nGas Pipeline - Belief Systems So belief systems, a simple definition of a belief system is that it is a set of habits which ultimately control an individual’s behavior or actions, both consciously and unconsciously, towards a given task or as a reaction to a given situation\nSo just to refer to the belief system work worksheet. I want you to make a list of your belief systems around the different gold categories once you have made the list of those beliefs, I want you to analyze whether that belief system is in line with your goals\nyour beliefs create your emotions, your emotions, create your actions and your actions ultimately control your outcome\nFire Hose 1 - Your Current Mental Programming Bench Green Color Garden 2 Overhead Railing Garden 2 Pillar Garden 2 Overhead Lamp References ",

If I can do this, things will get smooth: Speed Reading -\u003e Dance -\u003e Object of Desire Book: Atomic Habits Book: Compounding Living Room Memory Palace Speed Reading by Jonathan Levi !\nThis is the life changing course that I have ever done. I have to come back to this as often as possible. Make it part of my daily life and you will live my dreams. Go on Naresh, its time to live your dreams!!! I am keeping some location in Memory Palace unused, if need later for some information.\nMain Door Front - Progressive Overload Throughout the course, we’re going to be using a training methodology called progressive overload, progressive overload is a fundamental principle at the core of all strength and fitness training, and it’s applicable to your mental skills as well. The basic idea is to always be training near or just below your limits. You always lift weights that are relatively heavy or run at a pace that is relatively challenging, by doing this, you avoid the injury and the damage and the frustration that could result in training beyond your limits. But you also avoid getting stuck in a rut by not pushing yourself enough. Most importantly, every time you progress, you immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain your progress.\nMain Door Peep Hole - Pomodoro technique Pomodoro technique, which is a method used to prevent fatigue and frustration. Basically, you’ll train for twenty to twenty five minutes and then take a five minute break and then train for another twenty to twenty five minutes and then take another five minute break after four pomodoro or twenty to twenty five minute periods, you’ll take a longer break, a 15 to 30 minutes. This method has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to maintain focus and creativity. So check it out\nMain Door Back - Memory Well, once you’ve used your working memory to process, understand, and interact with a piece of information, your short term memory is what keeps it in your mind for about 15 to 20 seconds. This might seem like a really short amount of time, and it is, that’s why for the majority of the course, we’re going to focus on improving the connexion all the way from your working memory to your long term memory. This is because if you do a good enough job creating those short term memories that’ll stick till you get to the end of a page or an article, you’ll only need to use some simple review techniques and regular maintenance to keep things in your long term memory, where we eventually want all our new information to remain.\nThis means that right now, our working and short term memory are the primary bottlenecks. Without the right infrastructure and base skillset to improve these two types of memory, speed reading is pretty useless, even impossible\nMain Door Ganpati - Buffers Our brains do use several different types of buffers to work with the various types of information. This basically means that words, ideas, images, and scenes, they don’t all use the same path to get to the short term memory.\nMain Door Magnetic Stopper - Neural Network But basically memories are created when your brain sends neurotransmitter signals to two neurons at the same time. This strengthens the connexion between those two neurons and presto, you have a new memory. This is an important point to make because it shows that the creation of memories requires connexion between two neurons or a connexion to existing neurons in your brain. The other thing you need to know is that when this happens over and over again the cluster of neurons and their synaptic connexions become something called a neural network. From artificial intelligence research we know that neurons work better in these types of clusters. This means that when several neurons fire together the signal is actually amplified. That’s why it’s so crucial to store memories in several connected neurons and to further connect them to the memories that we often use.\nBecause there are so many connexions and stories and experiences around that piece of information your brain determines that it’s critical and will never erode it away. Knowing this can benefit us tremendously. The process of super learning necessitates that we create more connexions to the information we want to learn\nWall - neuroplasticity Well first and foremost I want to dispel the myth that children’s brains are somehow better at absorbing new information or that they have a higher neuroplasticity.\nRecent studies have actually shown that this is simply not true. The reason that children seem to learn with more ease is that they’re learning literally every waking hour and all information is new and exciting information for them. Furthermore, research shows that our brains do play by the use it or lose it rule. Most adults lose the ability to learn rapidly simply because they settle into their day-job and they stop learning in the volume that they used to as children, not because their brain chemistry or neuroplasticity have actually changed\nWall Bulb Holder - Games Playing games with Wall Bulb Holder and getting electric shock\nSo, as you go along throughout the rest of the course, I want you to remember that the games are important, but that the real test of your super-learner skills is whether or not you can memorise everyday information, speed-read your daily reading assignments, and learn actual skills faster\nWall Switch Board on left - Chunking Chunking - psychological phenomenon\nThe chunking system is very good because it’s an entry level mnemonic technique. It’s not only much faster and easier to learn and play with than some of the heavier visual memory techniques we’re going to learn later, but it’s also a critical element of the overall technique. This is to say that even after we teach you the methods to remember things way more easily, you’re still going to be chunking details or memories into groups of three or four so that they can better comply with the requirements of your short term memory. Sure, we could train your short term memory to hold a larger number of items, but that would only slow you down and place a larger cognitive load on you. At three to five items there is no slow down so it’s preferable to work in this range. Furthermore, by chunking groups of items into one entity, we can stack five chunks of five objects each into our working memory and effectively store 25 items in our short term or working memory without any cognitive overload. Because of this massive advantage, you’ll notice that all of the world’s top memory athletes use systems that are based on chunking combined with powerful visual and spatial memory techniques that we’ll be learning later on in the course. The other nice thing about chunking is that it works with just about everything. Take a sequence of numbers or a couple pieces of information. For example, brown dog, tall fence, lost Frisbee. You can even try to chunk information about people into neat little bundles. It might seem strange, but remembering that information in chunks is actually much easier than if it were to be put all together\nSamsung TV 65 Inches - Dual Coding and Brute Force Learning Dual Coding. Remember how we learned that the brain has different buffers for working memory depending on the type of information it’s interacting with? Well, in dual coding, we try to get different types of working memory buffers to activate at once, thereby increasing the chances of retention and storage in long-term memory. In the coming lectures, we are going to emphasise how important it is to look at a text or a piece of information from different angles, to ask different types of questions and to use different senses, such as vision and smell, or even emotion, to engage with the material in different ways than you normally would. And this is why. This is also why we advocate a style of learning that I like to call “brute force” learning. This is a term that has been lifted from hacking, where a hacker will attack a server by trying thousands or even tens of thousands of passwords in the same form rapidly, often with a few different machines or different angles.\nSamsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer - Visual Marker In addition to all the other steps we have to take to prime our memory, it’s best that we also learn to transform concepts, ideas, and other important information into imagined visual pictures, or what we call markers, as soon as we possibly can. It won’t surprise you to learn, additionally, that the best and most memorable types of visual markers are strange, bizarre, or emotionally connected to memories. After all, adult learners need to connect information to pre-existing knowledge, and as always, our hippocampi are busy working away to determine what stuff matters and what stuff doesn’t.\nIn the last lecture, we told you that one of the goals of SuperLearning is to transform any and every piece of information you want to remember into an image, which we call, a marker.\nUltimately, you have to learn to go with what images come naturally for you. Try to lean towards whatever type of image you find most conductive for you to remember, but just make sure that, number one, there’s as much detail as possible.\nAll this is concept. No Memory Palace for this !!!\nHow Do We Apply Visual Memory To Reading\nOne of those future lectures will come up when we get to speed reading, and it’ll explain in detail how you’ll use regular intervals of pauses during your reading. This is not just because speed reading is very exhausting for the eyes and for the brain, but also because these pauses allow us to optimise the process of learning\nYou see, just like there are at least three types of memory, there are also three stages, or processes, of memory. They are, encoding, storage, and retrieval. Where most people get into trouble is that they try to do all three at once. Have you ever read a paragraph or a page of text only to realise that you’ve been deeply immersed in thought and you haven’t actually paid attention to anything that you just read? This is what happens when you’re trying to do all three memory processes at once. On the other hand, if you’ve ever studied process operations management or economics, you know that grouping similar tasks together is an efficient way to minimise waste. I mean, you don’t wash one shirt at a time and then put it in the dryer all by itself. You wash all of your clothes together, put them all in the dryer together, and then fold them when they’re all done, right? With reading, you’ve been doing it one shirt at a time, trying to multitask the washing and drying and folding for each shirt. It’s just as inefficient as it sounds, and so we’re going to separate it out into three separate processes to reduce cognitive strain and improve overall efficiency\nNow I know what you’re thinking, how exactly do we do that? Well, because of the limitations on your short term memory and the inherent difficulty in multitasking visualisation with reading, we’ll be learning how to make short pauses of about one to two seconds after each page, or even take micro pauses of just fractions of a second after reading information-dense paragraphs. You’ll also take longer pauses every 10 minutes or less to review what you’ve already hopefully put into the beginning stages of long term memory. As we’re going to discover, when we learn about space repetition software, you brain needs to periodically repeat and review information in increasingly long intervals in order to remember it and prove to the hippocampi that it’s relevant and worth remembering. This is similar to the idea that you must continue weight training to improve your strength and increase muscle mass. If your brain, like your body, thinks that the information you’re using is a one off occurrence, it won’t waste the time investing the resources to remember it.\nIn short, this is why we take small pauses after each page and much longer pauses of 15 to 30 seconds after each chapter, to play back and retrieve our stored markers and perform a form of spaced repetition to improve our long term retention. This also means that it’s not a bad idea to spend a few minutes a week reviewing markers and ideas from books you’ve read months or even years before, if you really wish to remember them\nWhile we’re discussing images and visual markers, it’s worth noting that not all markers have to be visual. In fact, smell is actually a more memorable sense than vision. Of course, we can’t understand an entire book using our sense of smell alone, and so we’re focusing on images, but if you read about, say, chocolate, and you can conjure up the smell or the taste of chocolate, that’s actually a great marker for remembering that data point. And if it works for you, even better. Whatever types of markers we use, whether they’re visual or sensory or some other types that we have yet to learn about, it’ll almost certainly be a mix in the end. This mix of markers, when retrieved and reviewed, reminds us of the details that we’ve decided we need to remember. And when combined with our existing knowledge and opinions and ideas about the content, it allows us to dual code and store information into long term memory very quickly and very effectively\nSo, instead of reading back over the chapter, we can retrieve all of the markers we’ve created and start thinking about how they’re connected together logically. We play them back almost like a film strip in our minds, and that helps our retrieval\nCreating Effective Markers For Better Memory\nFirst and foremost, high quality markers represent specific ideas or concepts that can be easily understood.\nNext, high quality markers are themselves imbued with rich detail such as colors, textures and so on.\nThird, high quality markers are clearly and logically interconnected to one another.\nFourth, high quality markers emphasize outcomes or resolutions, not questions or initial conflicts\nFifth high quality markers come in volume. At this stage, the more the merrier.\nAnd finally, markers draw upon existing memories whenever possible. Great.\nSamsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer Table - Visual Memory \u0026 Reading logical markers. These logical visual markers follow convergent thinking, meaning that they condense and put things together. The truth is though that logical markers are often so trivial that we don’t even notice we are making them. They may be somethings as simple as a negative emotion of anger between Austria-Hungary and Serbia or as complex as a schematic or a diagram that explains all the interactions between all the different warring nations.\nExamples of logical markers can include: emotions, such as excitement, anger, or confusion; symbols, such as question marks or exclamation points; arrows, x’s, circles, and check marks, and even diagrams, schematics, or flow charts\nyour success really depends on you using your skills and finding that they’re useful in your daily life. If you don’t believe that these skills are useful, you won’t put in the effort and ultimately, you won’t get very far at all. And so, it’s only fitting that your homework is to try these new skills out with, well, just about anything.\nGo, check out the PDF syllabus, do that assigned homework, and make sure that you’re learning how to create those high quality markers.\nSamsung 11.1.4 Bar TV Unit Top (Light Brown, Old) TV Unit Middle Drawer - TV Unit Left Slot - TV Unit Middle Slot - TV Unit Right Slot - Shoe Rack - Video/Podcast Single Sofa - Learning Language Go and Watch the Video. Benny Lewis (Carl Lewis / Boney Kapoor).\nBenny Lewis, he struggled very much to learn Spanish in a classroom setting with a textbook. He said that things didn’t seem real enough and he couldn’t extract enough meaning or really get a feel for the words he was trying to learn. Oh boy, does that sound familiar. He also told me that he learned languages primarily by speaking to people in real life situations. He would try to get by in the language or listen to people in the supermarket speaking that language.\nAgain, Anki is a really amazing tool for learning languages. I’ve been using it myself to brush up on my language skills in three languages and I can tell you, it really, really, really works.\nUnurprisingly, the secret to learning new vocabulary words, you guessed it. Using visual or sensory markers. Most people go wrong because they try to link one group of sounds, the English word, to a new group of sounds, the word in the foreign language. This creates one very weak connexion between the two pieces of information and that’s why you immediately forget a word when someone tells you the translation. Instead, you need to link this new and foreign combination of sounds to an existing mental marker, image, feeling, or smell that’s already densely built into a neural network. !!!\nThe Face on the Wall - Remember Name Tailoring The Skills: Never Forget A Face Or A Name\nInstead, you should try to connect that person to a visual marker of another person or even to a visual idea. Try to connect it to another person with the same name or even a story you heard about someone with that same name.\nIndoor Bicycle - Learn Faster Make actionable items from these points.\nHow To Learn Faster Using Proper Preparation Techniques\nOftentimes when we sit down to learn we are full of excitement, passion and enthusiasm. We are eager to dive in, to sink our teeth into this new subject and give it our best shot. But the truth is that while it’s great to have enthusiasm for learning, enthusiasm without planning can do more harm than good. Ok.\nWhat had gone wrong? Poor planning, instead of sitting down to get a broad overview of the Russian language, a view of the forest from 30000 feet, I had gone straight for the trees rather than developing a plan for how I would shift between vocabulary and grammar or transition from one grammatical case to another, I simply jumped in and what looked like the beginning.\nThis concept, the idea of preparing and structuring your learning in a logical way before you even start comes up a lot in accelerated learning circles.\nIn his accelerated learning book, disguised as a cookbook, the four hour chef life hacker extraordinaire Tim Ferriss shares his two frameworks for preparing to learn anything faster dis deconstruction. How small can I break things down into their basic units of learning, such as individual vocabulary words or grammatical rules?\nSelection, what are the 20 percent of those units that will give me 80 percent of the benefits? Pareto’s principle\nSequencing, what is the best order in which to learn these units stakes?\nHow can I use psychology or social pressure to condense my timelines and push myself to learn faster?\nWhatever you’re learning, thinking ahead is key. Recently, when I interviewed Zac Evans, creator of the popular piano Superhuman Accelerated Learning Course, he told me a very similar story. Zac explained to me that a significant portion of the success he generates for his students lies in simply thinking ahead, breaking things down into individual skills or sections, and then tackling them in the right order. Zack also pointed out that unless we plan out our learning in a methodical and deliberate way, we fall prey to bad habits, wasted time or complacency. Zac himself learned this by accidentally leaving his camera recording during a practice session, only to find out that he had wasted the entire two hours playing pieces he had already mastered.\nSo before you begin to study a new subject, there are a number of questions that you must ask yourself.\nWhy am I learning this information and how and when will I actually use it?\nFor WAS find the relevant sections that need to be done. Period.\nNext, what level of understanding or knowledge do you need? One question that I’ve long felt is missing from the conversation on preparation is that of depth. There are many levels of understanding and knowledge ranging from being able to recall when something sounds right to basic recall of facts, a holistic understanding or at the highest levels, actually being able to think originally and independently on a subject to what level do you need to know the information you are learning? Do you need to be able to recite other people’s works word for word and challenge them for your PhD thesis? Or do you simply need to know where to look something up the next time a patient presents those symptoms, the extent to which you need to know something dramatically changes the way that you will go about learning it and how much time you’ll spend on it.\nUp next, how can this information be broken down into small parts and recombined into broader categories or themes? What are the units of information in this subject? Are they verses of a poem? Functions in a programming language, chords on an instrument or words in a lexicon? Once you have determined these divisible elements, are you able to classify them into broader themes such as historical periods, key signatures or parts of speech?\nIan Chapman. Just do what is needed, and the rest you can keep deliberating.\nNext, what are the most important things to learn based on my personal goals? As you likely know, Pareto’s Law states that 80 percent of the benefits are derived from 20 percent of the work unless you’re looking to become the world’s best at something, this generally means that you can save yourself the effort on a great majority of the information in any given subject. In music, most of us can probably skip learning the individual frequencies and physics of each note, just like most non-native English speakers, shouldn’t bother with the future perfect continuous case.\nMostly the best order will be the order of course from Udemy/Pluralsight. But in case of Ian Chapman, I was selective.\nUp next, what is the right order in which to learn this information? Learning a heap of grammatical rules doesn’t make a lot of sense if you don’t know enough words to form a single sentence. Similarly, it’s probably not very useful to learn to read music until you know which keys play, which notes, as I learned when I tackled Rush and the order in which you learn things really matters and you can never reclaim the time spent learning the wrong things.\nHow wil this information be useful to me in future.\nNext, how will I actually access this information? Knowing how you’ll access the information you’re learning is often just as important as knowing which information to learn.\nAll these pressure might give me heart attach.\nThe next question, what will your study schedule look like and how can you compress timelines? As Tim Ferriss teaches in his books, Parkinson’s Law states that work expands to fill the time you allotted. We all know the feeling of writing an entire semester’s final paper in a matter of days or hours. So why not use this nifty psychological hack to our advantage by structuring our study sessions in methodical ways? Based on the answers to the questions above, we ensure consistency and persistence. Plus, by adding high stakes social pressure and condense timelines to the mix, we kick ourselves into high gear. My friend Dr. Benjamin Hardy, psychologist and author of the book Willpower Doesn’t Work, calls these automatic constraints forcing functions one to learn acro yoga fast, prepare for an advanced workshop three months from now, hoping to learn a new technology at work, volunteer to teach a workshop on it next quarter. By adding real world stakes, you’ll be motivated to structure your study plan and actually stick to it.\nBreakdown the bigger task into smaller, manageable tasks.\nThe next question is equally important. How will I measure and track my progress in order to determine whether or not you are moving forward at the right place? It’s important to have a clear metric of success. For this reason, I often teach students about the idea of smart goals specific, measurable, ambitious, realistic and time based. If your goal is to get better and excel, it’s pretty hard to assess that. If your goal is to learn six new features of Excel, including pivot tables and macros by December thirty, first you’ll have a much easier time planning for success as you check off each individual feature. Plus, remember that what gets measured gets improved, but what gets measured and reported improves exponentially.\nIt is easy and straight forward to make plan to finish domain related course/but for technical courses it is really very difficult. In technical courses there are a lot of unknows (e.g. Microservices RI).\nAnother question you should ask is what will I do if things don’t go to plan? The last few questions will, with any luck, push you towards taking on some aggressive and ambitious learning goals and achieving them in record time. But the higher you shoot, the more likelihood there is of failure and we all slip up. Sometimes, no matter how positive you are, nothing is more frustrating than watching your best laid plans fall apart. In these times, it’s easy to spiral downward, beat yourself up or give up altogether. That’s why the best managers plan for occasional failures ahead of time. What exactly will you do if you fall off the bandwagon or get stuck on a particular subject? How will you get back on track and prevent one little slip up from derailing you and causing you to give up completely? A phenomenon that psychologists lovingly call the what the hell effect? Will you book extra sessions with a private tutor, make up time on the weekend, adjust your study schedule accordingly, and give yourself some slack by creating a specific action plan for what happens when you inevitably fall off track? You can minimize the damage and ensure that you waste as little time as possible. Armed with these nine questions, you are prepared to well prepare, you now understand why thinking ahead and creating a methodical success plan is far from a waste of time. In fact, it’s quite possible that every minute of preparation will save you an hour or more of deliberation. That’s why the next time you set out to cut down a learning tree, I know you’ll take a good, hard look at the forest first and then make sure your axe is razor sharp.\nKitchen Curtain : Starting with Kitchen Curtain Kitchen Counter / Platform Kitchen Top Drawer Unit White in Color (First Up) Kitchen Top Drawer Unit Red in Color (Second Down) Corner Unit Gas Stove Gas Chimney (First Up) Kitchen Window (Upper) Water Tank/Tunki Kitchen Sink Dustbin (Blue in Color) Microwave (Silver in Color) Microwave Stand (With Wheels) Fridge (Blood Red / Passion / Poison Color) Diwan (Chocolate in Color) : : Starting with Diwan Balcony Window Sofa Set Dinning / Sofa Table Window Platform Blinds Corner Table Telephone Speaker (Ceiling) Tubelight Projector ",

I am able to recollect the entire course in \u003c 5 minutes. Thanks to Memory Palace and Jonathan Levi. I will always be greatful to you.\nRamp - Fear Fear and Our Brain’s Default Setting\nIf I had to pick the number one silent killer of our productivity and the biggest thing that holds people back from being as productive as they can possibly be, that would be your own brain and its desire to keep you safe.\nNow, all of us struggle with procrastination from time to time. In fact, in many cases, our procrastination is simply a symptom of fear, whether it be fear of failure, being concerned we won’t live up to expectations or produce good enough work, or even if it’s just a task that’s outside of our comfort zone, we’ll rationalize reason after reason.\nBut it’s not just physical harm that your brain is trying to protect you from. It’s also emotional harm.\nBut because our brain doesn’t distinguish the difference between physical or emotional harm, it wants to avoid both.\nCourage is not the absence of fear. It’s the willingness to act in spite of fear.\nSeating Arc - Overwhelm Overwhelm - How it holds you back and how you can beat it\nNow, here’s the thing. When your brain gets overwhelmed, it’s kind of like a breaker being shut off. Your brain just completely shuts down. Now, I hear this from my clients and my students all the time. They’re overwhelmed and they don’t even know where to start. And in many cases, when this happens, they freeze, it paralyzes them and they’re just stuck in the mud. But the problem is those tasks don’t go away. That only makes the problem worse. I do have some good news for you. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. You see, overwhelm really is subjective. It’s much more of an emotion that it is a reality. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way. Please don’t leave this lecture without really internalizing this fact. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way.\nThe first thing you’ve got to do when you get overwhelmed is to get all those thoughts out of your head.\nAnd once you’ve got it on paper, you can then start to organize it and create a plan\nSoft Skill Courses - So many and which one to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\nTechnical Course - So many and which one to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\nToDo - Endless List, what to do what not to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\nDaily Activities - So many of them. Make exhaustive list of everything.\nSoil/Earth - Plan Failing To Plan\nThe first thing that planning is going to do for you is provide clarity now, planning forces you to get clear on what it is you actually want to accomplish. It allows you to really decide how to invest your time and what your most important tasks are. Now, as silly as this sounds, many don’t even know. And it sounds simple, I know, but I can’t tell you how often when I sit down to write out the three most important tasks that I want to accomplish that day, how frequently I pause and have to really give it some serious thought. This is a really critical first step. Another key benefit of having a plan is the locks you in. And once you lock in to your priorities of the day, it’s really going to help you lock out all the distractions and all the things that pop up along the way. They can get you sidetracked. And lastly, a plan creates great subconscious accountability. When you’ve got a system and you’ve got a plan and you actually write out what your top priorities are for the day, I’m telling you, it will nag at you until you get it done. And I’ve found that this will at least double your chance of actually completing that task if you commit to it in writing. Please don’t underestimate the power behind this particular advantage, because be honest, we all love Crosson. Those things off our To-Do list. Now, if you don’t consistently plan your week and plan your day and you’re not doing that already, your job is to start planning your day and planning your week before the end of this course, I’m going to get into more depth and walk through this in more detail in future lectures. But like Benjamin Franklin said, failure to plan is planning to fail.\nSoft Skill Courses - So many and which one to do !\nFollow the plan on Notion.\nTechnical Course - So many and which one to do !\nToDo - Endless List, what to do what not to do !\nDaily Activities - So many of them !\nVehilce Mirror - Perfect Waiting for Things to Be Perfect\nOur next silent killer of productivity is waiting for things to be perfect, you see, unproductive people are great at waiting for the time to be right. They’re great at waiting until they feel like it, waiting until they’re in the mood to get started. The door of opportunity is right there for them to walk through it, but they’re waiting for it to open now. Rarely does the perfect time ever come. So let’s take a look at our rocket right here. Now, with the rocket such as this one, there’s something called escape velocity. Now, a rocket must reach a speed of about seven miles per second to escape the earth’s pull of gravity. But almost all of that energy is needed at the beginning when a rocket first launches. You and I are no different. But the good news is that objects in motion tend to stay in motion and all you need to do to get started is to get started and the rest will usually take care of itself.\nTree - Multi-Tasking The Myth of Multi-Tasking\nSo this next silent killer of productivity might surprise you is multitasking\nWe’re only able to actually focus deeply on one task at a time. In fact, according to one researcher, instead of making you more productive, multitasking can actually double the amount of time it takes you to complete a specific task while also potentially doubling your mistakes. That’s a pretty significant mental cost. And to make matters worse, when you get distracted. It takes you almost 15 minutes on average to get fully back in the flow\nyou’ve got to turn that phone off, shut off your email alerts and put everything else aside. And just by focusing on your most important task, first, by blocking off that time, specifically where all you focus on is that critical task, you’ll see huge results\nPath of diminishing returns. : The point of diminishing returns refers to a point after the optimal level of capacity is reached, where every added unit of production results in a smaller increase in output\nMobile is a big distractor. Follow 1 hour strategy\nFence Wall - Fake Breaks ! Time Leaks \u0026 Fake Breaks\nI am sitting on the Fence Wall, and taking Fake Breaks\nYour brain and your body does need time to rejuvenate and needs breaks in order to perform this optimal level. But these types of activities, surfing the web, checking your email, looking at your Facebook page, these are fake breaks. They don’t actually reset your willpower, reset your focus or help you increase your energy. They’re actually making it worse now.\nGo for a walk Try Indoor / Outdoor Cycling Try Rowing Machine Try some dancing !!! Avoid screen time. Fence Railing - Emotional ! Poor Emotional and Energy Managment / EE\nIf you are sitting on Fence Railing, it has to be power pose\nAmy Cuddy is a social psychologist and professor at Harvard Business School, delivered a great TED talk that shows the power of influence we have on ourselves and specifically regarding the way that we use our own body. In her studies, she put participants into high powered poses or low power poses for just two minutes now. You’ll see over here on the left, we’ve got our high power poses. This one right here has been dubbed the Wonder Woman Pose. But in each one of these scenarios, you’ll see that they’re making their body wide and or expanding their stance, and over here on the right hand side, you’re going to see low power poses. They’re making themselves small or closing their body language. And after just two minutes, they test the participants hormone levels to see if it had any effect. And quite frankly, I found the findings astounding. Now, those who struck the high power pose, so a 20 percent increase in testosterone and a 25 percent decrease in cortisol, cortisol being a hormone most times associated with stress and those that spent two minutes in the low power poses saw a 10 percent decrease in testosterone and a 15 percent increase in cortisol\nSpeed Limit - Email One of the biggest Silent Killers of Productivity\nVisitor Parking - Time Managment L Shape - Time Managment V/s Self Management (Small L V/s Big L).\nAnd whether we like it or not, each minute is only made up 60 seconds and each week one hundred and sixty eight hours. And those are going to pass us by at the same speed no matter what we do. And in reality, when we’re talking about time management, what we really should be talking about is self-management, because the one and only thing that we have one hundred percent total control over is what we do and how we manage that time. Now, my suggestion is don’t wish you had more time. Instead, wish you had better self-management, better systems, better tactics, better habits, and probably most importantly, better execution on the stuff that you already know how to do and actually put it in a play which you already know you should be doing but aren’t doing. These are the things that really make a difference. And these are the things that you have. One hundred percent total control over time. If you don’t know how to manage yourself, if you don’t know how to set up and actually consistently use the right systems, it wouldn’t matter if you could make more time up here. You wouldn’t be able to fully take advantage of that extra time. So I’m going to encourage you right from the start to instill a new belief. And it’s not about time management. It’s about self management and making the most of the time that you already have. Because if you do make the most of that time that you already do have, you’re going to double and triple the results that you’re getting now.\nStart using in-door cycle and rowing machine, while watching movies\nOverhead Park Fencing / Railing - Spending time V/s Investing Spending Time vs Investing Time. A big clock hanging, and time is ticking.\nNow, one of the biggest mistakes, I think unhappy, broke and unsuccessful people make is in thinking short term versus long term when making decisions.\nAnd most people, myself included in the past, is typically focused on how they’re spending their time each day instead of focusing on how they’re investing their time\nAnd there’s a huge difference now when most people think of time management productivity, it’s in regards to getting the maximum number of things done in a day, a week or a year. But I’m going to encourage you to look at it from another perspective. When you invest in something, you hope that will give you a return that’s greater than what you invested. For example, if you put five dollars into a stock, you hope to get much more than that, five dollars over time. And I encourage you to look at time the exact same way. Spending your time is about getting things done, investing your time is about setting up systems and delegating tasks that will literally save you hours and create new hours in the future.\nNow, many people won’t take the time to train someone else to do that task or automate that task because it usually requires more effort in the short run.\nMany of the people that I speak with, a lot of them have trouble delegating and letting go. But once you understand the difference between spending your time and getting more time back in the future by investing your time, it becomes a real game changer.\nSo focus more on time investing activities that will pay you back each and every single day and are going to make you more and more productive.\nIdentify tasks where there is scope for investing time\nSpeed Breaker - Sleep The Importance of Sleep to Your Productivity\nAccording to the University of Pennsylvania, if you get six hours of sleep per night for two weeks straight, which is a little less probably than you need, your mental and physical performance declines at the same level as if you stayed awake for 48 hours straight.\nAnother solution can be to take what I call a power nap. And most sleep research will suggest to keep it to less than 30 minutes to keep it from interfering with your normal sleep schedules and circadian rhythms. Even something as small as a 20 minute nap has been proven to improve your memory\nLet power nap be power nap\nGas Bank Door - Water The Healthiest Energy Drink That Most of Us Have Access to For Free!\nWhen your brain is fully hydrated, you think faster, you’re more focused, you have more creativity and more clarity. But most importantly, you’d be more productive. While your brain only makes up about three percent of your body mass, it actually uses up to 20 percent of the water and nutrients that you take in. And just like with sleep deprivation that we just got done talking about, even small amounts of dehydration can lead to big effects. Just one percent of dehydration can lead to a five percent cognitive decline\nIf you’re not sleep deprived and you don’t have as much energy as normal usually is because of dehydration. Start with water and nine times out of ten, that’s going to solve the problem. So I’m going to encourage you to drink water early, drink water often and stay hydrated. You’ll notice the difference and I promise you’ll thank me later\nGas Bank Fire Extinguiser - Energy, Mood, Emotional Mastering Your Energy, Mood \u0026 Emotional State\nYou’ve got two choices. You can direct your attention to those things that are going well, things that are great in your life, things that are where you want them to be, and things that are within your control. And when you do that, how do you feel? You might feel a sense of gratitude, hope, appreciation and progress. But what if you instead choose to focus on what’s missing in your life, what’s going wrong, and focusing on all the things that maybe you’re going wrong in that are missing, that you can’t even control in that instance, how do you feel\nThe tough part is that most of our thoughts and behaviors are habits, the things that we do and thoughts that we think over and over again without even really giving it any conscious thought. So over time, you’ve developed automatic patterns and you habitually lean towards thinking one way or the other\nAnother major contributor to your mood is how you’re using your body at any given moment. As I mentioned in that earlier lecture, studies have shown that something as simple as how you use your body posture and have a hormonal effect specifically as it relates to testosterone and cortisol\nGas Bank Window - Will Power How Will Power Really Works - I can sticker all over the window\nLover’s Point - Knowing and Doing Knowing and Doing Are Completely Different Things\nGive me a mediocre idea that’s flawlessly executed and I will win every single time over a genius idea that never gets off the ground. Now, most people love to put their focus on the latest and greatest thing, the new idea, the sexy idea. But those that execute the fundamentals actually get the best results\nNow, I’m sure you’ve heard the term knowledge is power, but I disagree. I don’t think knowledge really is power. I truly believe that knowledge is potential power, potential power, but only power, if actually acted upon and used that real power comes from its application or execution because without action, there’s no results\nBasketball Board - The Warren Buffet Productivity Secret I think one of the best ways to get better results is to model with the ultra successful people do sustain success is never one hundred percent luck. That just happens to people. Those who are really successful always leave a trail of clues. They simply approach things differently than the rest of us. Now, I mentioned Warren Buffett in a previous lecture and in a previous section, but I want to come back to him one more time. And just as a reminder, he’s worth more than 60 billion dollars, and that’s with a B and as one of the most successful investors of all time. So what’s his secret? His secret is simply saying, no. This is a quote from Mr. Buffett. The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything is sounds too simple, doesn’t it? I mean, we can all pronounce the word no. We all know how to say it, but just about all of us don’t say it enough. Maybe you’re a people pleaser and you want to help others. Or maybe you’re ambitious and want to tackle it all. Or maybe you’re like my wife and you just have foma fear of missing out. Either way, if you’re overwhelmed, this is the place to start. Scott Densmore wrote a great article about a story that he was told to by a friend of his. His friend was a pilot for Warren Buffett at the time. And one day Warren went up to his pilot and jokingly said, the fact that you’re still working for me tells me I’m not doing my job. You should be out there going after more of your goals and dreams were and then asked the pilot to make a list of his top twenty five priorities or goals just to write them all down on a piece of paper. So I threw out a couple of examples right here on this slide to mimic a little bit of what the pilot went through to jot down some of the top priorities and goals that he might have had once the list was complete.\nWarren asked the pilot to review the list and circled the top five that were most important. And those top five, that would make the biggest impact, the ones that he prioritized over everything else. And he insisted he could choose only five\nSo let’s say, for example, that these were the five. That he chose to enroll in school, you know, maybe take the family to Disney World, see lose 20 pounds and create a website. And moved to Texas, who doesn’t want to move to Texas now after these top five were selected, Warren asked him to create a plan for accomplishing all five.\nThere’s nothing earth shattering in this yet, right? Pretty standard stuff. But after they went on to discuss how he was going to accomplish the top five items, Buffett asked the pilot what he planned to do with the remaining 20 items. What are your plans for those? The pilot said, well, those 20 are a close second to my top five, and they’re still very important to me. So I’ll work on them intermittently as I have time while I’m working on my top five items. Wrong answer. Warren said that those other 20 items are now his avoid at all costs list. No matter what, those things get absolutely no attention until he’d succeeded with the other five.\nNow that right there is the magic, the power of focus and saying no and you will hear all the really successful people talk about it. Now, many of us have a to do list, but how many of us have a not to do list? Think about the difference in clarity and focus when you have tunnel vision on your top priorities and nothing else, and this is critical not only for your goals, but for your daily activities as well, potential distractions will only increase with new technology. And as you become more and more successful, those are never going to go away. You will need to become more and more successful and skilled as saying no. So you might as well start exercising that muscle now. So let me ask you. What’s in your top five? I encourage you to perform the exact same exercise using the page and the resources, write down and just get it all on paper, your top twenty five goals and dreams and really sit down and circle the top five. The most critical five is going to give you 80 percent of your results and take you where you want to go.\nBasketball Board Ring - The First and Most Technique Start your day with focused effort on your most important, highest value and highest impact activity. Now, here’s a way you might go about figuring out what that task is, and you can ask yourself what is the one thing that if you accomplished it today, would make your day a success and would make everything else that follows easier\nBasketball Board Pole Support - Your Productivity Secret Weapon The biggest challenges with many of these tasks is that they lack a deadline\nBasketball Court Inner Circle - Parkinson’s Law Using Parkinson’s Law to Your Advantage\nI highly encourage you to challenge yourself with aggressive deadlines, to really take your productivity to the next level.\nBasketball Court Outer Circle - Themes How to Use Daily Themes to Enhance Your Productivity\nHe gives each day of the week a theme so that he can assure that he’s not just putting out fires all day and working only on the urgent tasks, but he’s working on those things that will really have an impact on the results of both companies\nNow, this strategy helps you be intentional on what you’re focusing on, but also utilizes the power of batching activities. Batching is simply a type of time management strategy that groups similar tasks that require similar resources together in order to streamline their completion in the most efficient way possible. Now, batching or using theme days minimizes distraction because it keeps your focus narrow. You’re only focused on one item or theme at a time. It also allows you to get into the flow much more easily and be efficient with your resources.\nHarvard Business Review, Peter Bregman notes that our productivity goes down by 40 percent when we try to focus on several things at once. In addition to batching, setting a theme to your day really allows you to make sure that you’re putting in enough time on the important high value activities that are really going to give you your best results.\nBasketball Court Center - Resurrecting Your Dead Time Lately I am watching a lot of movies.

    "content": " What is Emotional Intelligence EQ V/s IQ The EQ Model Your Brain and EQ How to Improve EQ Mistakes to Avoid in Your EQ Development Using EQ to Manage Relationships. Identifying EQ Around You Common signs of low EQ. Examples of the high EQ Using EQ in Daily Life Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5 What is Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize how your emotions are governing your decisions and your thinking. Once you know how emotions affect you, physically and mentally, you are able to learn how to change your reactions. This does not mean changing your emotions or hiding them. What is means is that, you want to identify your emotions and understand why you are feeling a certain way and be more aware of what to do differently and how to do things differently.\nSo bascially, EQ is about identifying how you feel and taking an opportunity to decide how your emotions are helping or hindering you in the work you do and the relationships you have.\nEQ V/s IQ A high IQ doesn’t predict success at work. EQ is a much more reliable indicator of success at work. Whereas People with high EQ are the majority of the top performers. They make better work decisions for themselves, their peers, and their companies. They are well situated to take on exciting opportunities within and outside of their organizations and they make more money than people with low EQ. Executives with high EQ are more likely to succeed than those with high IQ.\nThe EQ Model The concept of emotional intelligence can be broken down into four sections.\nSelf-awareness Your ability to be aware of your feelings in the moment, as they are developing. You feel them and you understand why they are there. It’s about getting to know yourself, listening to yourself, your body, your mind, and your heart. It’s about being self-aware. As your body physically reacts to people and situations, are you feeling the changes?\nSelf-management It involves managing your emotions and the resulting reactions. What you say and do. How well are you managing your emotions? Are you allowing them to drive what you say, think, and do? This isn’t about putting your emotions into a box and sealing it closed. It’s about actively overseeing your reactions.\nSocial awareness It is your ability to recognize and respond to the needs of others. Now some people at work express their needs openly such as I’m frustrated and I need help. Others may not be as explicit with their feelings. You may have to learn how to “read” those people and then to ask questions. People with high social awareness are observing and listening to people. They are empathetic.\nRelationship management It involves considering your emotions as well as those of others as you develop and master relationships. People skilled at Relationship Management build bonds with others. They value teamwork and collaboration, and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nYour Brain and EQ Evolution plays a trick on us humans in such situations because our brains are wired to process and react with big emotions before processing in a logical fashion. In other words you might react emotionally in tiny invisible ways or big bold ways before reacting logically.\nBut research has confirmed that your brain is flexible, malleable and changeable. You can decide to behave more logically rather then being emotionally hijacked. What this means to you is that you can change your behavior, and decide your response in trying and unpleasant circumstance.\nHow to Improve EQ The first and foremost way to increase your EQ you need to learn how to identify the emotions. It begins with understanding how you feel in the grip of emotions. Your body may feel the emotions before you actually “get it”\nLearn Why You Feel It: Once you begin to note how you feel, the second step in self-awareness is to connect the feeling with the reason or cause. Your body might show signs as a result of emotions, even before you realize what’s going on. When you are able to feel a physical sign of it, you will become better at understanding what is happening and why. The people, places, events, times of the day that create a certain emotional reaction. So you’re starting to read your body which is fabulous. Now you need to write down the situations that make you feel one way or another.\nWhat Are Your Buttons?: To change your EQ you need to start with information about the people, places, and times of the day, and so forth, that cause you to respond in ways that are ineffective or unproductive. What pushes your buttons? What provokes you, creates a strong emotional reaction? Is it a silent or covert reaction? You’re fuming on the inside but you’re smiling on the outside. Or, is it a loud one? Having an expression on your face that says it all. Once you identify and become self-aware of your buttons you can begin to manage them, as follows:\nIdentify where in your body you are feeling stress, anxiety, excitement, and so forth. This is the “Feel It” part of the exercise. Next connect the dots by considering the situation you find yourself in when you get sweaty, your mouth is parched, you feel lightheaded, or so forth. This is the “Place It” part of the exercise. These situations are your buttons. Buttons that when they’re pushed, they bother you. Final step, think about and describe why you feel a certain way in a certain situation. The above steps will help you to understand and manage your emotions, and use the emotions in constructive and productive manner.\nMistakes to Avoid in Your EQ Development Becoming too cautious about showing your emotions. They assume that having high EQ means lowering emotional reactions or limiting feelings. That’s false. Remember you are a human, not a robot. Emotions can be managed, not bottled up. Worrying about offending people. EQ leads you to a deeper consideration of what you want to express, with your words, emotions, and actions. Don’t avoid giving solid thoughtful constructive feedback because you are cautious of hurting someone else’s feelings. EQ is the solution to everything. I wish this were the case, but it’s not. EQ isn’t the answer to all of your challenges at work. I’m sure you’re aware of some projects that require hard skills right now, more than soft skills. For example, EQ won’t help you grow your programming skills. So be sure to view your professional development as a balance of hard and soft skills. Failing to ask people to support you. Don’t keep your EQ progress a secret. Remember that emotional intelligence is the leading indicator of success at work. So why not share your interest and ask for support as you build it? Using EQ to Manage Relationships. Relationship management is your understanding of your emotions and how you use that ability to manage interactions with others, in a manner that leads to success for both sides or parties. People skilled at relationship management build bonds with each other. They value teamwork and collaboration and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nIdentifying EQ Around You Social awareness is your ability to observe what others are saying with their words, and with their bodies, and to examine how it affects you.\nSo the first part of strong social awareness involves watching and listening to others. The second part is learning more about the people you work with so you can better understand how to shift your approaches to partnering with them. You learn what people respond to and what they don’t. You learn what they like and what they appreciate and what they don’t enjoy. You don’t need to have a different or unique approach for every single person you work with. You need to start paying more attention to their signals. They are sending them all the time, all day long.\nCommon signs of low EQ. Emotional outbursts. Sudden outbursts that are not a regular occurrence or a trend in this person’s behavior. Passive-aggressive behavior. Someone who is filled with frustration on the inside yet avoids confrontation or honest expression of feelings. Big Reactions. Allowing small things to cause big reactions. Someone who gets stressed easily and can blow some things out of proportion. Failing to ask how others feel. Even when other people show emotions in their faces, their bodies, and in non-verbals. Inability to read social cues from others. Doesn’t take the time to read or pay attention to some signals. Self-centeredness. It’s all about him or her, all the time. Lack of empathy. Someone who is unable to understand and share the emotions of others. Lack of emotion, avoids showing their feelings at any time, stoic. Lack of self-awareness. Someone who doesn’t know his or her buttons, has no idea what sets them off. Blaming others for his or her mistakes. Examples of the high EQ Asking questions for clarity when receiving criticism Listening, 100 percent. And listening, before speaking. The ability to apologize without being nudged to do so Showing passion, frustration, anxiety, the full range of emotions, yet in an appropriate manner. Learning. People with high EQ are looking for ways to improve, to learn. Sharing praise and criticism, openly and with details. Demonstrating empathy. Reading emotions and relating to them. Being assertive but not aggressive. Making mistakes and freely admitting it. Wow, that’s a huge sign of high EQ. Number ten. Valuing the goals of the team and the organization above his or her own. Using EQ in Daily Life The best way to work on EQ is to actually start using it in Daily Life. In this section, I will capture how I have been using EQ in my life, and dealing with emotionally stressful, anxious and stressful situations.\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5 ",

    "content": "Introduction\nBut the truth is that that you can control your emotions. You can get really good at experiencing the ones that you want and avoid the ones that you don’t want.\nThe truth is that emotional self-control is possibly the most valuable skill that you could ever acquire. It helps you cope with whatever life throws at you. It helps you prevent stress, anxiety and fear. And it helps you unlock your abilities, frees you to live the life that you really want, and actually has been linked strongly to what differentiates between people who are successful versus people who are not.\nNo one ever told us that it was the lack of emotional management that ends up leading to drama, to suffering, to addiction, and to poor decisions, and that all of those things can be avoided.\nWe’ll focus on three of the most undesirable emotions uncertainty, insecurity, anxiety and worry and fear, and how you can use emotional awareness and self-control techniques to take back control of your emotions and feel better now. We will teach you what your emotions really mean? How to recognise them and how to direct them in a way that really allows you to move towards your life goals and really your desires and what you want to create. We’ll teach you how to get out of your head and become the observer of your emotions as they happen so you can avoid being hijacked by your own brain and really feel control again. So after learning these tools, you’ll be able to really feel good, or at least better. No matter what’s going on around you or what life throws at you. You stop your emotions from spiraling out of control. You’ll feel resilient and capable of handling life stressors. You stop raising thoughts and calm your anxiety, your de-escalate, overcome, or prevent your fears. You develop mindfulness by focusing on the present moment, and you also feel confident and in control of your emotional state and your life.\nIn this course, you will learn what emotions are and how they work, how to recognise them and identify them. How to direct your thoughts so that you can direct your emotions. How to reframe situations that make you feel bad. Find the blessing and then feel better. You’re going to learn stress reduction techniques, proven processes for preventing yourself from losing control. Emotionally, you learn tools to de-escalate. When you’re feeling anxiety or fear, you’ll learn NLP or neuro linguistic programming techniques for rewiring your emotions and anchoring positive ones. You’ll learn how to cope using humor and other self-empowerment techniques. You’ll develop self-confidence, uncertainty, and you’ll master the feelings of hopefulness and feeling joyful.\nMind Body Emotional Connection\nAnd so that’s a really great illustration that all it takes is our imagination to make us feel something. And so what I’m here to tell you is that that is always happening to you. What you are thinking in your mind is causing your emotions. So it may be that the way you perceive things is you’re seeing things around you and you’re thinking about the things that you’re seeing and that’s causing an emotion. And so you blame the things that you’re seeing. But truly, the source of your emotion doesn’t come from those things around you. It comes from what’s going on up here (head).\nAnd it shows you that it’s not just that your emotions respond to your thoughts, but your whole body does, too.\nSo I hope that that gives you an illustration of how powerful your mind truly is in creating reactions, both in your emotions and in your body.\nJoeel’s Journey\nBecause understanding my emotions and being able to manage them and changing my state has really transformed my life. And in many ways it has saved my lives.\nYou see, the emotional journey started when I was young because I moved around a lot. I used to move around like every year, sometimes twice a year. I went to so many different schools. But what it taught me was how to look at things as opportunities. How to be able to shift my emotion. How to be able to make friends quickly, how to be able to be an observant of my environment and learn from that environment.\nAnd those tools helped me sleep better, helped me go from failing school to getting straight A’s and going for my Bachelor’s, Master’s, and so on. Because it helped me be in a better state, helped me how I reacted to situations, how I reacted to stress and things like that. It helped me get grounded of the possibilities that I had in life and that had control of that, that I can control not only what was happening internally, but that even if I couldn’t control what was happening externally, I still could choose how I felt and how I reacted.\nBut what I did was that I saw it as a year sabbatical, a year to understand my emotions, a year to understand the root cause of some of the things in my life and make necessary changes. So I knew that when I came out of that, I was gonna be a better person, not only for myself but those people around me\nKnowing that if that was the last thing that I did, I was gonna enjoy that moment with her. So the point was that I was choosing my emotions regardless of how extreme my situation was. And was it always easy? No. Was it times that I felt anxious, depressed? I felt fear, yes. But I didn’t try to stay there.\nSo just remember that your emotions impact every aspect of your life. Scientifically, Whether it’s your health, whether it’s your relationships, your career, your mind is the tool. And you have to either see it as either directing your life, or you directing it. So are you gonna take the the the wheel and say, “Okay these are my emotions, this is what, and I’m gonna drive ’em to create what I want. or I’m gonna let my emotions take over, and decide what kind of life I live and what kind of experience I have regardless of my external situation.”\nThe tools to develop the awareness, give you the tools to change your life, to choose your emotions, and create your reality as it did mine throughout my journey and throughout my life. And again, these tools transform my life. And when I was real sick, I believe that these tools was what’s helped me heal and get to the point where I’m at today.\nNatalie Journey\nAnd I observed that when people change the way they thought, their emotions would change. And I found me changing the way that I thought and my emotions were changing. And so I reached a breaking point, and I decided it was time I had to transform my life. And literally, I transformed every aspect of my life at that point. And part of that process was I delved further into learning about the mind and emotions, and I ravenously devoured anything that would teach me about my own empowerment, teach me how to be in control of my life, and not to live the status quo, and not to give away my power. And so I learned to own my emotions instead of others.\nAnd so, as I started to learn that I’m not my mind and that I can control it, I would start to catch myself doing that. And I just remember this distinct day that I almost got hit by another car. And I went down the path that I often do, of imagining what would happen, then that I realized I was doing it. And I stopped my movie, and brought my attention back to the present moment. And so that was one of those first moments where I felt empowered that I can control this.\nAnd in that split second, I realized I don’t like this. And this isn’t even real. And in that moment, I just shut off the emotional feeling. It just stopped, because I fully realized I am in control.\nAnd I have since been able to use that same strategy, if there’s something else going on in my life. And I know my mind is all wrapped up in it. And I realized my mind’s wrapped up when I say, hey, this isn’t real, it’s not even happening right now I’m just thinking about what happened at work, or I’m imagining what’s gonna happen later. I don’t have to feel this, and I’m not going to when I stop.\nSo I got pretty good at blocking the negative stuff, but I hadn’t quite gotten good at practicing the positive stuff.\nAnd so I used a lot of tools, actually the ones in this course, to identify what I wanted, and what I saw my future as. And here’s the key here, that before when I would think about the future, and during this experience to think about the future, but all I could see is this thing I want this dream I have is not possible right now, this isn’t going to happen. I couldn’t see past my circumstances. And so by using the tools that I teach in this course, I was able to get to the place where I could look to the future, and remember who I am, and remember what I dream of, and what I really want to do with my life, and how I wanna feel, and actually go there now, and live the dream in my mind, feel the emotions, even though the thing that I want isn’t happening, and be able to do it without feeling bad that it’s not happening now. And that was life-changing. It was like that final tear of being able to feel fully in control of my emotional state. And so what I’ve learned through all of this, is that the ability to control your mental and emotional state is the true definition of self-empowerment and knowing that you have a choice is the true definition of freedom\nBiological and Psychological Foundations\nOur stress is constant. We’re in a perpetual state of fight or flight. Therefore, this prolonged stress can lead us to breaking down physically and mentally. You have to keep in mind that when you’re in that state, it’s almost like if your body’s exercising but exercising all the time. So imagine if you were exercising all the time. What would that do to your mind and your body if you actually never give it time to rest?\nOne of the strongest indicators is our connection between the left prefrontal cortex, which will call PFC and the amygdala. So the PFC is critical because it tells the amygdala that needs to quiet down by sending inhibitory signals so it helps our negative emotions subside and go away. It tells it you need to really stop because you need to stop feeling this way or is not rational or is not practical. So really quiet this down. Studies have shown that people who have a weaker connection between these two areas of the brain have more difficulties managing and regulating their emotions. So now you may be thinking, what is that area of my brain is not well developed. Am I out of luck? The good news is that you’re not and that you can help build those connection. It is important to keep in mind that the brain is like a muscle and that by working those areas, you can strengthen your connections.\nOne of the ways that you can work out that sections through mindfulness meditation, you do this by becoming an observer of your thoughts without judging them. You’re looking at it and saying, OK, that’s what you’re thinking. That’s what. Processing and and so on and so on, but by doing this, you’re observing how the brain can easily exaggerate a situation and go at unnecessary tangents. And by doing this, you’re activating your PFC, which is a critical part of your brain to manage your emotions. So in other words, you’re training it. You’re building that muscle up in your brain to let it know it’s time to turn on reasoning and critical thinking. Activate. It’s almost like turning on a light switch.\nSo what does help is the first thing is planning and using your imagination to see what you want to create in the future and practicing self-control. Therefore, you can plan some of the activities. You can even plan some of your rewards that you’re going to get once you achieve certain goals and things like that. I’ll give you an example. If you have a habit of constantly checking your phone, you can force yourself not to check it until you reach a goal or finish some work that you’re supposed to be doing instead. And by doing this again, you’re building that muscle. So by practicing self-restraint, you’re actually building that emotional part of yourself that will help you not only short term, but actually long term. When you’re faced with adversities, when you’re faced with stress, when you’re faced with challenges, because it’s going to help light up that part of your brain that’s going to tell your brain, OK, need to slow down before you react. You need to slow down before you actually take the next step. And let’s process this. Just keep in mind that with everything, it takes practice and consistency. So in this course, we will provide you the tools that if you practice them consistently, it will help you create the life in a better way. It will help you reach for your goals and dreams, and more importantly, it will help you stay in a better emotional state.\nMOVE. MOVE. Don’t Get Stuck.\n",

    "content": " Overview Time Management Fundamentals Benefiting from Prioritizing Becoming More Productive: Prioritizing and Managing Time Actionable Why !\nI wan’t to build a weighted system for prioritizing task and activities.\nOverview We’ll talk about prioritizing your tasks so you are working on the most important, highest return tasks first and moving away from working on things you really shouldn’t work on.\nTime Management Fundamentals Introduction\nIf we just manage our time, but haven’t prioritized what we need to do, we could find ourselves being very efficient working on the wrong things. If we have prioritized our tasks, but aren’t good at managing our time, we will know what we have to do, but be frustrated because we just aren’t getting to it\nProductivity in Perspective\nHaving peace doesn’t mean everything is slow and you aren’t moving. For me, peace is a result of productivity. Peace comes from movement and progress\nProductivity isn’t just being active, productivity really means results. When you are productive, you feel a sense of pride in your work, which leads to satisfaction with your work.\nAt the Heart of Time Management\nFirst, we need to identify the things that are actually robbing us of our time. Sometimes I know I should work on a certain project, but I get lost in my email or I get lost on social media or reading the news. If I were to make a list of the top 5 things I need to do every day, checking what my friends are up to on social media would not be on the list.\nAnother issue at the heart of time management is the size or scope of our projects. I find when I take a large project and break it into smaller pieces, it’s a lot easier for me to make real progress. I tend to stay on schedule instead of being overwhelmed by the scope of a huge, massive project that seems too big to finish.\nI’ve found one of the biggest thieves of time management is having to do rework because a project wasn’t done right the first time. Mistakes, large or small, can cause us to pause what we’re doing and open up old projects. You know how hard it is to stop working on one thing, jump into something else, and then go back. This is one of the biggest time wasters and could be avoided if we just do things right the first time. It takes time for us to go back into the old project, try and remember what it was all about, decipher code and specs, and figure out how we need to fix what we didn’t do right in the first place. Doing things right the first time might be the best time management tactic you employ.\nOnly 5 things to do for a given day Avoid Rework Redefining Work and Productivity\nWhen you’re a manager, you’ll help other people do their job, but managing people and being in meetings while not getting any tickets done is definitely a paradigm shift. It can feel very unproductive. I came to realize my best contribution towards productivity was to help others become more productive. When I switched from ticket finisher to helping others finish tickets, I became more valuable in my role.\nManage Expectations :\nPoorly defined specs make for an uncomfortable conversation. The results could cause your customer to lose confidence in you. When you don’t manage expectations, you might take the blame for a perceived failure and assume costs. You might have to work harder to get something delivered by the deadline. These are mistakes you might make in the beginning of your career, but you should learn from them quickly. When I define project specifications, I like to understand what the MVP, or minimum viable product, is. I want to know what a successful product delivery would be and have that definition communicated properly to me and my customer. Too often, I have assumed what project priorities were. Instead of assuming, I would have been better to have the right conversations and ask the right questions.\nLab Activities and Client Work Saying No\nWarren Buffett said, “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.”\nTime management guru Tim Ferriss, author of The 4‑Hour Workweek, says, “What you don’t do determines what you can do.”\nThere are plenty of reasons we find it so hard to say no, but let me tell you, saying no can also be extremely empowering.\n“Instead of making a to‑do list, you should make a won’t‑do list.” Have you ever thought of listing the things you won’t do? Items might end up on this list because you don’t have time to do them or you’re not interested in doing them, or they simply don’t align with what you really need to work on. The idea of a won’t‑do list empowers you to work on the things that need your attention. saying no is critical to time management.\nWon’t do list (Notion) Becoming a Finisher\nUnfinished projects can really clutter our minds. They take up space and they nag at us. This impacts our ability to focus on the things we really need to work on.\nSometimes, unfinished projects are simply hard to resume. It’s hard to jump into something from 6 or 12 months ago and pick up where you left off. You have to remember where you were, why you did things a certain way. Figure out if the original specs are still applicable, etc.\nFinishing something right the first time is usually faster and more efficient than delaying until later, which usually increases the amount of time needed to finish. So what do we do about unfinished projects? Well, the most obvious answer is to finish the project. I know this is sometimes easier said than done. Maybe we need to change the scope of the project and then finish the new scope. Sometimes it’ll make sense to, as Seth Godin says, pivot. Perhaps we need to evaluate the project and then just pull the plug. In this case, you would say, I’m not going to finish it, and then write it off and don’t worry about it unless the outcome becomes relevant again. You would do this to get closure on those projects, allowing you to concentrate on the things you need to concentrate on now. This also helps you protect your reputation. You don’t want people to think, well, I can’t give that project to her because she never finishes her projects. Finally, you gain confidence as you finish and deliver your work. I’d say these are some pretty good reasons to become a finisher\nMultitasking: Friend or Foe?\nMultitasking makes you 40% less efficient, not to mention multitasking has an impact on our memory. Multitasking impacts our stress level and a host of other things, including our IQ, our EQ, our creativity, our learning, and more.\nI do it right and I don’t have to rework it once I’m done. I can get more high‑quality work done faster than people who say they can multitask.\nEffective Calendaring\nOne of the most important things I put on my calendar is a block of time to work on certain projects. If I block out time on my calendar, I’m much more likely to actually spend the right time on it. If I need quiet time or I need to work on something that takes a lot of concentration, I put it on my calendar with the appropriate amount of time. I find this much more effective than just saying I need to work on something sometime.\nManaging Distracting Tools\nSimilarly, many people have found they’re more productive when they turn off their email client and only check it two or three times a day. This is a weird habitual shift, especially if you are used to monitoring your email all day long, but I invite you to give it a try.\nCheck your email at, say, 10 and 2 and 4 and see if you are able to concentrate better on the projects you’re working on.\nIf text messaging is a major distraction, either silence your phone or hide it so you’re not tempted to check your messages all the time. Just as you turned your email client off, you can turn your chat off.\nThe easiest way to do this is to find the status setting and set yourself to do not disturb or busy. I do this when I get on webinars, and it’s really nice to not have a chat pop up while I’m in a meeting. Schedule certain times to check your collaboration tools. These really are great communication tools, but just like email, if you are watching for messages all day, you might find you’re slower to work on your projects.\nGoing back to the concept of multitasking, just schedule when you will watch these tools and then honor your schedule. Basically, if you’re working on something you need to concentrate on, schedule time where you turn off distractions so you can be more effective.\nBenefiting from Prioritizing Aligning Priorities\nPeace comes from making sure you’re working on things you need to work on instead of things that are just busy work or just filling time.\nThe priorities others have can have a real impact on how you prioritize things (working with others).\nHow do the priorities of your organization impact your priorities (job).\nHow aligned are the things you are prioritizing with organizational objectives? It’s important to consider your boss’s priorities. Her priorities should be aligned with the company priorities, but might be more hyper focused on her boss’s priorities.\nPersonal priorities aligned with your team’s priorities.\nWhile organizational priorities are always important to support, it’s worth noting that helping someone make progress with their personal priorities can pay off with stronger professional relationships that could help you later in your career.\nCovey’s Four Quadrants\nQuadrant 3 is urgent, but not important. For example, that meeting you got pulled into where you wondered why you were there. I can’t help but remember the times the CEO of a company I worked at would walk pass my office on his way to the conference room and say, Jason, I need you in this meeting. I knew I didn’t need to be in those meetings. I wasn’t sure why he had me there. Maybe it was for moral support. All I knew was I had things that were urgent and important that I needed to work on, and I didn’t need to be in those meetings. These interruptions seemed inevitable, whether it’s a phone call, email, text or somebody pulling us into a meeting, whatever it is, there are going to be plenty of opportunities where we have something that appears to be super urgent, but really isn’t important. How much time do you think you should spend in quadrant 3? The question really is, how can we avoid getting sucked in to quadrant 3? That sense of urgency is going to pull at us, but we’ve got to figure out how to resist the pull.\nStep 1: Create the List\nRevisiting Covey’s Four Quadrants\nQuadrant 1 is where we’re working on Urgent, Important tasks. It’s always good to work on important things, but we don’t want working in quadrant 1 to be our normal. When we’re always working on urgent things, we can feel out of control. When I’m in quadrant 1, I get stuff done and I’m productive, but the stress level is not something I want to sustain. I’m guessing you spend more time here than you want. Quadrant 2 is the goal. This is where we should try to spend most of our time. Quadrant 2 tasks are Important, but Not urgent. Quadrant 3 is Urgent, but Not important. It’s weird to think we might spend any time here, but when things are urgent, they all of a sudden seem important, even if they’re not. For example, leveling up on a video game might feel urgent, but for most of us, it’s not important. Quadrant 4, where things are neither urgent, nor important, is generally where we waste time. We should try to avoid this quadrant completely. Here are two important questions\nFirst, in which quadrant do you spend most of your time? Are you spending more time than you should in quadrant 1, 3 or 4? If you are, what can you do to move out of those quadrants? Second, where should you spend your time? I am not saying you should only ever be in quadrant 2, you’re going to have to spend your time in 1 and 3 sometimes. Urgent is urgent, spending time in urgent will sometimes be out of your control. But at the heart of the question is this. What can you do to spend your time in the quadrants where you need to be instead of where you have been? This might be your most important takeaway from this course.\nI want to make an important point about quadrant 4. There’s a big difference between leisure time activities and activities that steal your time. Let’s say leisure time is where you need to take a break. There’s nothing wrong with taking a break. Sometimes we need to take a mental, physical or social break. We can recharge and refresh so we come back to our projects with more energy and better focus. Contrast that healthy break with something that doesn’t give us a break or recharge or refresh us. I would argue the activities that help us work better are important, which puts them in quadrant 1 or quadrant 2, whereas activities that don’t help us are not important, putting them in quadrant 4.\nI guess what I’m saying is, don’t feel guilty for taking care of yourself, even if you didn’t have that on your task list. We haven’t really talked about quadrant 3 yet. This is a weird quadrant. Why would you work on something that is not important, but urgent? I think the quadrant 3 tasks I have the most are interruptions. This could be someone walking into my office and chatting or getting engaged in an online chat or email conversation. These become urgent, but could easily be classified as not important. I saw a suggestion online that said, if it’s urgent, but not important, figure out a way to delegate the task to someone. You could also negotiate with others involved, the people who make the task urgent to see if their urgent task is more urgent or important than other things you need to do. Or, if someone comes into your office, you could kindly and assertively let them know that you want to talk to them, but you can’t right now, and could they put something on your calendar?\nWhen Everything Is a Top Priority\nHave you ever created a to‑do list where everything was a top priority? If so, you aren’t the only one to have that problem. My guess is, everything on your list was urgent. Doesn’t just knowing about the four quadrants give you a new perspective on priorities? If you find everything on your list is a top priority, I have an idea for you. First, focus on quadrant 1 tasks, that is Urgent and Important.\nYou want to work your way out of quadrant 1 by finishing or reevaluating those items. Eliminate urgent items that are not important, quadrant 3 tasks, by either reevaluating or delegating them. This should reduce a considerable amount of stress.\nThere’s a great anecdote I read about Warren Buffett having a conversation with his pilot. Warren asked his pilot about his career goals. He asked him to list 25 things important to those goals. He then asked his pilot to circle the five most important things from that list. Obviously, these were the top priority. When Warren asked about the other 20 things, the pilot said something like, well, the top 5 are my primary focus, but the other 20 come in a close second. They’re still important, so I’ll work on those intermittently as I see fit, at which point Warren Buffett said, “No, you got it wrong. Don’t work on those 20 things at all until you have the 5 you circled completely done.” The lesson I learned is that the 20 uncircled items are not important until I finish the top 5 things. If you can list 25 things you think are high priorities, circle the 5 highest items. This will show you what your real important priorities are. Focus on those before you work on the others. By this point, you have enough information to create your system. Make sure you honor it. You will have spent a lot of time brainstorming your tasks. You will have spent a lot of time identifying factors to help you prioritize your tasks. Working through those tasks will take time and effort. Trust your system, honor the system, and you should see satisfying progress as you work through your tasks in the right order.\nBecoming More Productive: Prioritizing and Managing Time Review of Tactics\nTurning off your email and only checking it at certain times of the day. Same with social media and even chat and collaboration tools\nCreating the system and then honoring the system.\nBut I’m sure having a clean and organized environment kept distractions down and helped him produce more.\nI could tell he was focused on getting rid of every single thing that didn’t have an impact on him or his current projects.\nUnderstanding Productivity\nBut, really, busy is not necessarily the same thing as productive. Busy should not be our goal. Our goal should be to produce the right things.\nThink about what your value to the organization is. If what you do is aligned with organizational goals, you will probably be known as someone who is highly productive.\nIf your goals and objectives are not aligned with the goals and objectives of your customer, which again could be an internal or external customer, you could be working on the wrong things.\nIf you are overwhelmed by the magnitude or scope of their goals and end results, simply break the project into bite‑size chunks that you can manage. Another way to approach being overwhelmed is to work backwards from the end result. You might not know exactly how to work forward from where you are at, but if you can define the end goal and then say, okay, what’s the thing that needs to happen before we can accomplish the end goal and continue that process working backwards to where you are, you will be able to create a path moving forward.\nFunctional, Digital Transformation \u0026 Domain Knowledge.\nDo the Right Work at the Right Time\nFor example, there are probably times during the day when you’re most productive with projects like coding or studying or writing, or whatever. Then, there are other times that are better for meetings or getting away from your desk. Think about when you have the most energy during your work day and when you are the most sluggish.\nJust understanding when I’m optimized to do certain types of work and block out those times on my calendar has really helped me increase my productivity. When you create those blocks, try to honor them.\nBody and Brain Hacks\nWhat can we do when we feel like we’re just not performing, when we don’t feel motivated or productive? I\nWhen you feel like you’re in a mental or a physical slump, a time when you aren’t effective and all you want to do is play a game or read an article or surf the web mindlessly, are there things you can do to impact your productivity?\nAbsolutely. Here are some ideas The first idea has to do with your diet. I know a lot of people use soda, coffee or energy drinks to help them feel awake and have more energy. I’m personally not a fan of using sugar for energy. Have you ever had to present in a meeting after lunch? I remember once I was on around 2 or 3 in the afternoon when the sugar crash was in full effect. There are healthier ways to impact your energy during your workday. The first step is to honestly evaluate your diet, specifically for energy management, and make changes to your meals and snacks. There are plenty of articles you can dive into about when and what you eat impacting mental and physical performance.\nAnother idea is something like mindful meditation or yoga, or something similar. I’ve learned to love going on walks in the middle of the day. I didn’t think it was doing much for me physically, like running or cycling would, but when I come back from a walk, I feel more energized and awake. My mind is clear and I’m ready to focus on whatever I was working on. Whether I’m picking up on something I took a break from or diving into an entirely new project, going on walks has had a significant impact on my ability to perform at work.\nI’ve realized that I work best when I get a full night’s sleep. I just needed to lay down and take a 20‑minute nap. consider taking a 5 or 10 minute break to go out and enjoy the sunshine.\nLaughing is another thing you can do to impact your mental or physical productivity. When you laugh, you actually release chemicals in your brain. Laughing does something to your brain. It can be invigorating and change your mood. If you’re looking for something to replace quadrant 4 activities, the Not urgent, Not important things that have been stealing of your time, consider the so‑called brain games you can find online. You can play these games on your phone or your computer. They are designed to stimulate your brain.\nHere’s a mind trick I sometimes do on myself. I’ll pretend I’m going out of town and only have a few hours to finish my work. I’ve realized right before a trip I’m super productive and get my important tasks done and delivered. Giving myself a short‑term deadline helps ensure I focus on the right tasks. If I only have, for example, 4 hours to work on a project, I feel an urgency to focus on and finish that project. I’m still amazed how much more I get done when I give myself this kind of artificial deadline.\nUnderstanding Your Value\nI want you to understand what you bring to the table. When you understand this, you begin to understand what you shouldn’t work on, perhaps what you should say no to or what you should delegate. When you understand the value of your productivity and assign a dollar amount to that value, you can better understand how and where you should work.\n80/20 and Working on the Right Tasks\nThe basic idea is that there are certain things you’ll do that will have a much higher impact on the end result than a lot of other things you do\nMark LeBlanc’s Daily HVAs\nWhatever your goals are, you can probably identify high value activities that will have a high impact on accomplishing your goal.\nWhen we consistently focus on completing our three HVAs every day, we should see measurable results\nThe magnitude of the HVA, or the time required to complete the task, doesn’t necessarily matter.\nTypically, I’ll work on my three high value activities in the morning. Once I’m done with my high value activities, I almost don’t care how the rest of my day goes. Of course, I still do things to help me be productive, but just knowing I got my three HVAs done gives me peace\nHow to Be Flexible When Change Is Imminent\nIn Stephen Covey’s book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, he talks about the concept of your circle of influence. Your circle of influence includes things you have an influence on. Outside of your circle of influence are things you don’t have an influence on. He calls this the bigger circle, or the circle of concern, He says too often we worry about or spend time on things that are in the circle of concern, but they’re not in our circle of influence.\nStephen says we need to make sure we’re working on and worrying about things that are within our circle of influence. These are the things we have control over. We shouldn’t spend hardly any time in the circle of concern. One of my personal goals has been to grow my circle of influence, which might mean getting into a position where I have more control over things happening around me. I’ve done this throughout my career as I’ve taken management and leadership roles, and as I volunteered for roles that have given me growth opportunities. This whole concept is very empowering and freeing. It basically says look, spend your time and energy where you can actually make an impact, and don’t worry about all of that other stuff. Of course, even when you have expanded your circle of influence, there will be people or things that can change what you’re working on. This includes internal or external customers, the market or economy, competitors, your boss, your family or your health. Think about who or what has power to pull you outside of your circle of influence. Because we work in highly volatile environments with so many changes in technology, we should understand and accept change. We need to understand we’re not always going to be able to work on the things we want to work on. Understanding, accepting, and working within change are life skills that will help us at work. Having said that, when you become a master of time management, prioritizing and working within your circle of influence, you are in a position to stand your ground a little better and have more control over what you do. Instead of being controlled by the whims that seem to randomly come up, you can say, you know what, those look like great ideas, but they’re not aligned with the organization’s goals, or those are great ideas and I’ll be able to work on them once I finish some of these other tasks. Becoming a master of where you spend your time helps empower you in those situations.\nLogging Your Time\nIf you feel like your schedule is out of control or you’re not making the progress you think you should, especially for the amount of work you do, I suggest you try a simple exercise. Start logging your time and analyze where you spend your time. You can do this manually with a spreadsheet or document, or even a piece of paper on your desk. Write down everything you do during the day. Even though you are in tech, manually writing this down might be a good way to figure out where you really spend your time. The key is to track everything, especially those 5‑minute breaks. You might learn that by the end of the day, the little breaks have added up. You could also look at time management or time logging apps.\nQuality-based Productivity\nLet’s talk about the impact the quality of our work has on productivity. The phrase that comes to mind, something I’ve heard a lot, is do it right the first time.\nActionable Planning for Productivity\nUnder Observation / Experimentation. Let me try, how it works for me. I somehow like to do this activity in morning.\nEarly in my career, I learned about the power of creating a plan for my next day’s work.\nI think it’s because I can focus on what is important for the next day instead of what is urgent, which is what I focus on if I plan the morning of. When you make a list of tasks to work on for the next day, make sure you schedule those tasks at the right time of the day.\nMy morning planning is more whimsical. If I plan the night before, emotions and urgency are not major contributors to how I plan. Planning the night before helps me focus on what I really need to work on, what is really important.\n",

How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day 18. The Truth About Talent 19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work Quote for the Day This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.\nVisual Markers 1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. So many years will go by to get there. So many years will still go by even if you do not get there. An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems Build system for everything that is important. 7. The Secret to Self Control The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. Things that you do not want to do, make it difficult to do. Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. Make a list of my temptations. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. 11. Walk Slowly, but Never Backwards The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it. So, I don’t have to wait for 6 months, 1 year etc. to become a good dancer. I can instead complete the reps in 3 months. This holds true for every postivie and negative aspect in life. 16. How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.\nHe explains that his goal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up and adding to his streak.\nRecording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t.4 One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not.5 The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\nThe most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire. This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made. Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get started because you don’t want to lose your progress by breaking the streak.\nThis is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure. Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.\nNever Miss Twice\nThe first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.\nThis is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.\nGoing to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.\nIn short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.\nOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. 18. The Truth About Talent 19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. ",

Kudos.\nUnderstand the Music: Dance is a three-way partnership between you, your partner and the music. Know the music well.\nTake Lessons\nFocus on rhythm patterns, not direction of movement: A step pattern—those fancy-looking moves that define a dance— is the bigger motion a couple makes on the floor. It combines a direction, which is where to move, with a rhythm pattern, which is when to make weight changes. A rhythm pattern, which can be practiced by stepping in place (also known as marking a rhythm), has to do with whether you step or don’t step on a beat of music and whether you get fancy and step between beats of music, not the geography created when you move around the floor. For the beginner, I believe understanding when to step (rhythm patterns) is far more important than where to step (direction).\nFocus on technique, not learning more step patterns.\nGet Out and Dance\nDance with a Variety of Partners\nDance Up: By dancing up I mean asking better dancers than you to dance. When you dance up, miraculously, things begin to work, and you’re able to move to the next level. You should dance up, occasionally, if you want to progress at a reasonable rate.\nRecover Seamlessly from Missteps\nWatch Great Dancers\nLearn Manners\n1. The Beat of the Music My breakthrough in hearing the beat (I use hearing the beat synonymously with feeling the beat unless the context suggests otherwise) came when I was able to hear that not all beats are equal, that some beats hit the ear differently than others. Some beats are accented. That is, they stand out; and the degree and type of emphasis can vary. Typically, accented beats are just louder, with more oomph, as if instruments or vocals are hitting the note on that beat harder. But some beats sound different because they identify beginning points, like the start of a verse or a chorus or other, more subtle, thematic elements in the music. To my untrained ear I didn’t always know why a beat sounded different; but, regardless of the reason, just hearing that not all beats sound the same is what I found to be important.\nThe neat thing about these different beats is that, if you listen carefully, they create simple, regularly occurring sequences. Yes, it was subtle; but in the background these different beats created patterns. Once I began to hear these arrangements, the beats began to show some distinction. They came alive!\n2. Counting Music: Finding the Sets of 8 Bookmark !!!\nCount Music – Hear the Beat by Counting Sets of 8\nCount Music, Hear the Beat - sets of 8, measures\nI believe learning to count, both the music and step patterns, is the gateway to intermediate-level dancing and above.\nCounting music is counting the underlying beats of the music. Doing so reveals the structure of the music. It pertains only to the structure of the music—not the step pattern being danced—and virtually all dance music is counted the same.\nThis is the only thing you need to know: virtually all dance music is counted in sets of 8 beats. It’s as simple as that. Sets of 8 exist because that’s how musicians compose the music; it’s how they give structure to the music.\nHe counted the music in sets of 8 beats. He counted 8 beats of music—“one two three four five six seven eight”—and then started over. He emphasized each count 1 of the music, the first beat of each set of 8, by punching the air with his hand. (And, to a lesser degree, he also emphasized each count 5, the fifth beat of a set of 8, with a smaller punch.) With the help of his hand motions I could hear that all the count 1s were, indeed, naturally emphasized in the music. (Lingo Alert: Sometimes the word “count” is omitted and a count 1 is identified as “the 1 of the music” or just “the 1.”) Moreover, I could hear that the 1s were beginning points that signaled the beginning of something new in the melody. The concept of a beginning point was subtle; but if someone identified it for me, I could hear it.\nright: All dance music, except waltz, shares a similar structure. Heck, most popular music, even the gnarliest rock or rap you’ve ever heard, probably shares the same repeatable, predictable sets of 8 as dance music.\nFor me, hearing sets of 8 is a two-part approach. First, using a more left-brain-linear-analytical approach, I try to identify the count 1s, the first beat of a set of 8. A count 1 stands out because it typically has an emphasis or accent. It also stands out because it’s a beginning point for a piece of the melody or other thematic element; it sounds like a natural place to start something. It’s the same type of feeling you get at the start of a new sentence.\nEven after I realized that sets of 8 existed, it took many, many months of listening and practicing and getting confirmation from others before I could hear the structure and it became second nature. Until I could confidently count sets of 8, I was never 100 percent certain I was on the beat.\nEXERCISE 1: COUNT SETS OF 8\nTo get started, spend time with a teacher or friend listening to a variety of music. You can listen to your own music collection; but also surf the radio dial and music websites that let you sample music, as listening to unfamiliar songs is an important part of the process. Count the sets of 8. If a song stumps you, move on quickly, because you have to hear it in the easy pieces before you can hear it in the harder stuff. Do the count 1s stand out? Do the 1s and 5s seem to have the same emphasis?\nTIP:The beat of the music is established by the percussion instruments, like drums. In general, don’t get distracted by lyrics.\nANOTHER TIP: When practicing the beat, in addition to counting, it’s always good to get some body movement. While tapping your foot is okay, the most effective way to train your body to feel the beat is marching in place, doing a weight change on every beat of music.\nThe Musician’s Measure\nThe order matters in the pairing of measures. There’s the first half, the measure that begins the set of 8, counts 1 to 4; and there’s the last half, the measure that ends the set of 8, counts 5 to 8. To hear the correct order, listen to the melody, especially the feeling that the first measure begins something and that the last measure ends it. Also, listen for the relative difference in emphasis on the count 1 and the count 5. The point to note is that the count 1 has a stronger accent than the count 5, which will help you distinguish between the 1 and the 5. (Recall from earlier, I said that John, the stranger who first helped me count music, also punched out the 5s with his hand, but to a lesser degree.) The order can be subtle—often very, very subtle—but it’s there, even if you can’t hear it. Like sets of 8, the natural pairing of measures is just in the count of the music.\nPhrasing, the way dancers use the word, refers to the structure of the music. While phrasing is not for newbies, I believe beginners who have had a few months of classes should begin to develop an ear for it. I’ll be gentle.\nOne set of 8 is also called a mini-phrase, a term coined by dance educator Skippy Blair. To the ear, a set of 8 or mini-phrase usually has a theme: a short piece of melody or harmony with a beginning and an ending. The themes of mini-phrases have some integrity, but they don’t tell the whole story. A mini-phrase, like a sentence of words, only tells part of the story.\nMusic also has “paragraphs.” A paragraph in music is often called a phrase of music or, more descriptively, a major phrase. Just as a paragraph is a series of sentences, a major phrase is a series of mini-phrases. To the ear, the theme of a major phrase typically encompasses the smaller themes of the mini-phrases to create a larger theme, which tells the whole story—a complete musical thought. For example, a group of mini-phrases can come together to form a chorus or verse, which is thematically complete.\nUnlike the mini-phrase, which is always eight beats (except waltz music), the number of beats in a major phrase will vary depending on the music. The most common major phrase is the 32-beat phrase, which is sometimes described as “four sets of 8” (4 × 8 = 32), easy to hear in everything from jazz to Latin to rock ’n roll. Also common is the 48-beat phrase, which can be described as “six sets of 8” and is considered standard phrasing for blues music.\n(Arcane technical info: Musicians call it 12-bar blues, a bar being slang for a four-beat measure: 12 × 4 = 48.) Phrasing is important, because at the intermediate level and above you will dance to the major phrases. You will choreograph step patterns in a way that acknowledges the major phrases, which will connect you to the music at a higher level. And women will love you for it.\nDownbeat and Upbeat Hear the Downbeat and Upbeat in Dance Music\nDownbeat and Upbeat, which is the natural pairing of beats that occurs in virtually all dance music.\nI believe the downbeat and upbeat are the secret to mastering the beat of the music. This is the pattern that got me to feel the beat, to bring it beyond my ears and into my body. When I hear it I know I’ve probably found the underlying beat (if I’m not sure I listen for sets of 8 to confirm that I’m on the beat). When I feel it, I believe it acts like an autopilot and keeps me on the beat.\nThe first beat of the pair, the downbeat, is often, but not always, a heavier or deeper pitched beat, as if it were created by a bass drum or bass string instrument. The second beat, the upbeat, is often, but not always, a lighter or higher pitched beat, like the sound of a snare drum or cymbals. Thus, instead of two beats sounding like thump thump or tap tap, which is how I simplistically described the underlying beat here, two beats really sound more like thump tap. If you say it out loud, try emphasizing it like this: thum TAA!!!\nWhen counting music the downbeats are the odd beats (counts 1, 3, 5 and 7) and the upbeats are the even beats (counts 2, 4, 6 and 8). The first step of almost every dance occurs on a downbeat.\nAs with most elements of music, the downbeat and upbeat is subtle at first. It’ll be easiest to hear in songs with upbeats that are strongly accented (I give some song suggestions in a moment). The emphasis on the upbeat varies tremendously, so expect it to be obvious in some songs and elusive in others. I find that swing music and blues music generally have pronounced upbeats, which is why it’s easy for me to hear the beat in those genres. Salsa, in addition to the profusion of drumming, tends to emphasize the downbeat, which makes it a bit trickier. A lot of contemporary music, especially rap, has easy-to-hear upbeats.\nEXERCISE 2: DOWNBEATS AND UPBEATS Listen for the downbeat and upbeat structure in a variety of music. Especially listen for how the upbeat hits the ear differently than the downbeat. Choose songs with pronounced upbeats so it’ll be easy to hear—you have to hear it in the easy music before you’ll be able to hear it in the hard stuff. Do you feel the lifting feeling of the higher-pitched upbeat? Does the thump tap of the downbeat and upbeat create a rhythmic feeling that better defines the underlying beat?\nRythm Patterns While there’s a long list of items that must come together to perform a new move, for the beginner, the two most important are rhythm pattern and direction.\nI believe the rhythm pattern, which tells your feet when to go, when to make weight changes, is what beginners should focus on first.\nwhen first learning a dance and, especially, for gaining an understanding of dance in general, the rhythm pattern (when to step) is more important than the direction (where to step) because it’s what connects you to the music.\nIt’s easiest to learn a new dance step if you break it into two-beat increments, which she calls dance rhythms (also known as rhythm units). So a dance rhythm is the number of weight changes in two beats of music (except waltz, see here and here). When you string dance rhythms together to create a step pattern, Skippy calls it a rhythm pattern, which is a combination of two or more dance rhythms.\nMeditate for a moment on the concept of two-beat dance rhythms. You learned in Chapter 3, “Downbeat and Upbeat,” that dance beats come in pairs, a downbeat followed by an upbeat, so the notion of two-beat increments should already make some sense. Dance rhythms give structure to dance; just as words are the building blocks of sentences, two-beat dance rhythms are the building blocks of longer rhythm patterns.\nThere are only two dance rhythms of great importance to the beginning survival dancer, single rhythm and double rhythm; and there’s a third, triple rhythm, which rounds out the set. To identify these dance rhythms, simply ask, how many steps are taken in two beats of music? If one step is taken it’s called single rhythm. If two steps are taken it’s double rhythm. And, no surprise, three weight changes in two beats of music is triple rhythm. I love single, double and triple rhythm because they’re so darn logical. Now look at the same three patterns, broken into two-beat dance rhythms:\nFor me, dance rhythm was the key that unlocked the door to dance. I believe the secret to understanding dance is this: almost every basic step pattern of a dance is some combination of single, double and triple rhythm (Triple rhythm, which involves a step between two beats of music). That’s right, almost any new step you learn in a beginners’ class, if broken into two-beat increments, will be a combination of these three simple dance rhythms.\nMarking Rythms Counting Step Patterns Posture and Dance Frame 8. Positions As you learn positions, keep in mind that to make a position look good you need good posture; and to make it work you need good dance frame.\nMovement ad Timing 10. Lead and Follow Dancing is just a conversation between two people . . . talk to me.\nDance is a conversation between two people, and lead and follow is the language. Before I knew how to lead, my dancing annoyed many partners.\nPart of my confusion was the illusion that I knew how to lead, which came from the assumption that I could learn to lead in class. While classes are a start, it’s hard to learn from classes alone. The real progress will come from practicing patterns on the social dance floor—trial and error—with a variety of followers. In particular, work with partners who don’t know your patterns and, every once in a while, with partners better than you (dancing up).\nSo, in essence, just focus on doing your dance frame correctly and not on how you’re going to keep her in front of you or how you’re going to make her go left or right or forward or back. The positioning of your dance frame will indicate where you’d like her to go.\nEXERCISE 15: SWITCH ROLES Leaders should try following and followers should try leading. This is a great exercise, and learning the opposing part could dramatically improve your dancing. If you try following and feel the difference between a good lead and a bad lead, you can improve your leading. If your follower tries leading, she can improve her following. ’Nuff said.\nConnecting with someone on the dance floor isn’t always logical. You’ll probably have the most fun dancing with women at your own level, and you’re probably going to dance the most with followers who follow you best. That doesn’t mean they’re the best followers. While there are rules for lead and follow, they are tempered by a subjective side: chemistry. Like conversation, for whatever reasons, you will connect with some on the dance floor and not with others. People are compatible in dance like they are compatible in conversation. If you converse well and dance well with someone, make note: you may have a connection that goes beyond dance.\nStep Pattern ",

The good news is that this is easy to implement.\nMy reading strategy has 3 steps: 1. Scanning the territory I am exploring, and defining my learning needs I always read with a clear purpose in my mind, which primes the brain to identify and prioritise the key ideas, and I only read books that serve my strategic purpose and which capture my interest and energise me. I don’t waste time on poorly written or boring books, I just move on.\nI have a very bad habit i.e. since I started, let me finish it. It is not serving me very well.\n2. Define clear goals before reading every book Set your intention and attention correctly, and you will remember more. Knowing in advance if you are reading to scan for ideas, or to deeply digest content that you know is worth mining for insight, is key. Low productivity is everyone’s enemy, eating up our time unnecessarily.\nThis calls for revision on Pluralsight course, Jason Alba\n3. Use methods that work for me to connect, distill and chunk the key ideas in any book Knowing some memory hacks will help you a great deal here.\nProcess of learning from books Before we start, let’s dispel a myth. When reading non-fiction, you don’t have to read one book at a time. Where did this idea even come from? Reading to learn should be goal-oriented, and it should be fuelled by energy and interest. So let’s unpack the process of learning from books.\nStep 1: Define your reading radar and learning needs The key to remembering the ideas and books that matter, is to deeply integrate the key ideas that are most useful to you. This is stating the obvious, but many people make the mistake of trying to read everything the same way and in the same depth. So by reducing your head clutter, you reduce the cognitive overwhelm that overloads and exhausts your mind.\nSo what does reading strategically mean? By being strategic, you will only study deeply the books (or chapters) that you will benefit from the most.\nI am always scanning Amazon, blogs and other sources of book recommendations. I have a list of topic areas that are of interest to me, and I tell people that I know are knowledgable in these topics. Recommendations or discoveries that hit my radar get a quick scan of reviews on Amazon or Google, followed by a buy or leave decision. If you have Blinkist (a book summary app) then this is a great way to get a fast overview of a book, and short-cut this process. I keep a list of books on my radar, and I regularly review it.\nIf I have 3 or more books on my radar across all topics on my reading map, I will speed read them first (Google “speed read” and you’ll find resources and tips). On first pass I scan the contents pages, read the chapter summaries, and then flick quickly through every page scanning for diagrams, bullet points, and content headings for interesting clues. I will then selectively skim read parts of chapters, to evaluate quality and overlap with other books I’ve scanned.\nStep 2: Define clear goals for reading every book What are my reading goals? If I don’t know, my interest is not peaked my brain is not primed to receive information in the right mode. So I will aimlessly wander into a book and potentially waste time.\nWhen I moved to Spain from the UK, I had to learn the language fast, from scratch. I learned from my language teacher Rocio that there are two types of vocabulary: “passive” and “active.” Passive vocab are all the words that you understand when you hear them, but that you find hard to access when you want to express yourself. These words are on the tip of your tongue, but just beyond your recall. Active vocab is all the vocab you can use when try to express something, without thinking consciously or searching for words. With use, vocab becomes an automatic component of your repertoire for communicating and moves from passive to active.\nIdeas and concepts are committed to memory in a similar way. So I read in one of three learning modes:\nPassive reading - to acquire general knowledge\nI’m reading for the pleasure of learning, and to stay up to speed and hope to stumble on great ideas and tools.\nThe goal for general knowledge reading is simply to enjoy the stimulation of new ideas, without the need to make copious notes or worry about forgetting things. I just accept that general knowledge reading enters into passive memory, and let go of worrying about recall. But if I sat down to recall the key topics and insights of the book, I might struggle.\nActive reading - to scan for solutions\nThe brain will not let go of problems. They circulate round and round in your thoughts. That’s why in GTD (Getting Things Done, the book by David Allen) he tells us for every to-do that we have, we should identify the first thing that needs to be actioned, and then commit when you will do it. Having done this, your brain will let go of worry, knowing that the task is scheduled. If you don’t do this, your mind will be full of worry about all the things that you need to do.\nSolution-seeking is easy because the brain wants to solve your problems. Relevant ideas and tools just jump out at you. The focus of reading is to first understand, and then capture solutions or ideas as they occur to you.\nActive reading - for deep integration\nThis is reading to deeply integrate ideas that are valuable to your career know-how and life goals, and that add to your specialist expertise or professional insights. You want to commit this knowledge to long term “active” memory.\nThese are the books that your first scan suggested are worth deeply reading. Usually I find such books are harder reading material, either because their concepts and ideas are new or challenging to me, or because they are densely packed with research or tightly argued and complex. They demand more time to digest, and are worthy of the investment.\nThese books I will usually read at least twice, and hold for future reference. So my goal is to understand the ideas on the first reading, and capture content to return to. The second reading is to digest, evaluate and decide how to take action on the new knowledge. We want on the second reading to commit the key ideas to long term memory, using all the methods in Step 3.\nStep 3: The right methods to connect, distill and chunk ideas So we’ve identified books that we need to actively capture in longer term memory.\nThe heart of your reading strategy is your choice of methods for digesting and committing to memory what you learn. Note taking is the basic vehicle for most of us (unless you are Dyslexic like Richard Branson, or have a photographic memory like Elon Musk). I use mind maps extensively, plus I capture in the Evernote app all my bullet point summaries of key ideas or quotes and research references.\nI use mind maps to make connections, and mentally sort my ideas out. You can read more how I do this here: Tom Board’s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.\nI use Evernote for word-based note taking, in order to make my reading easily accessible in future, after my memory has faded. I can also structure captured ideas in folders for specific projects or further study. Evernote is fully searchable, even for PDFs and photographed hand-written notes. You can also tag notes, create folders, add web links, record audio, or use a digital pen on the iPad.\nThere are three main memory hacks that I use regularly, depending on the situation:\nBuild a “mind palace”\nThis is an ancient method, which I learned from one of Derren Brown’s short audio books (Memory Tricks I think it was called). It goes like this. Think of a walk that you do often, and know intimately, or a house or other building that you similarly know inside-out. Then mentally associate places or rooms with what you want to remember, in the order you want to remember it.\nEach subject is located in a place on your route, or a room in the building, and you use imagination to associate objects in your memory with the subjects you want to recall. The more outrageous the images, the better for memory recall. Run through mentally the rooms/walk until you can recall these images and subjects reliably. This method is used, I am told, by many TED speakers for presentations. It’s useful if you need to recall information in a certain order, for a well-defined purpose. You can mentally ‘clear’ your walk or palace once an event or situation has passed, and re-programme your mind.\nSimplify and chunk\nSimplification consists of distilling and prioritising what is important, and so de-cluttering the memory of the less important stuff to remember. You can use post-it notes, or just make lists, to sift and prioritise ideas. The ‘expert disease’ is to think that everything is important, and so discard nothing. This just overwhelms your short term memory.\nChunking is a deeper method of ordering information so that you can hold more complex ideas in your short term memory, and think about them. Research shows that you have 3/4 “memory slots” in short term memory. If you try to hold more than 3/4 things in your head at once, you start to struggle. But chunking is a method of hacking this short term memory bottleneck, by grouping ideas. You can read more about chunking in the Quora post here: Tom Board’s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.\nFind helpful metaphors\nOur minds think in metaphors. Metaphors can be simple and generic like “up” or “down” or broad like “country” or specific like “the genome project” or “waste basket” as in the Apple desktop or the physical bin in your office or study. You can associate metaphors with new ideas or concepts, to make them easier to recall. If I say to myself that Malcolm Gladwell’s book Tipping Point “is like the moment I realise I’ve eaten too much and my body diverts all its energy and resources to digestion, and my thinking goes fuzzy as my head feels lighter” then I’ve likened it to a physical body metaphor. If that metaphor is meaningful to me, it will be memorable. Taking this further, if I want to convey ideas in a way that others will remember them, then I should choose familiar and universal metaphors to liken them too. Marketers use this trick all the time to introduce new products and services without triggering consumer’s resistance to change and newness. So in summary, maintain a map of your reading territory consisting of the topics of interest and all the books on your radar. Speed read or scan them, or use a book summary service, to prioritise your reading. Then selectively read deeply, and throw all the memory tricks here at the key books so that you can access the knowledge you need, when you need it.\nI would like to end on a simple idea that helps tremendously: be selective, and let go of guilt. Don’t treat reading books like a challenge that must be overcome. Reframe your reading as meeting different goals, and take pleasure and time to read the books that really matter. You will have less mental clutter, more time, and enjoy the process far more. Best of luck.\n",

    "content": "The project presented us an opportunity to create a new product that cut across three different divisions and technology stacks of the bank. This was a technology integration challenge, but even more so a challenge of coordination across different divisions. I think the most important action we took was to structure this new e-broking business as a separate organization to ensure it was not caught in the legacy organizational issues. I find it remarkable that more than twenty years later, when I look at large enterprises setting up new digital businesses, the key issues are still organizational – should a new capability be established as a new organization or part of the existing organization?\nWe wound up ActiveKarma after two years, but my first foray into entrepreneurship taught me many invaluable lessons – such as the importance of anchoring the business in a solid customer proposition, going slow to go far, managing cash flows, and so on. I was reflecting on how this ‘dotcom bubble’ that many of us lived through has been such an important milestone in the evolution of the digital age we see today and still holds many important lessons for enterprises and entrepreneurs. It showed the disruptive growth opportunity of Internet-based businesses; it also showed how dangerous it can be when business models and enterprise valuations are not anchored in cash flows but on speculation. The ‘dotcom bubble’ burst in a couple of years and it took Nasdaq fifteen years to regain its dotcom peak.\nThere is so much to talk about the McKC story and the learnings from it that it would merit a separate book. But at this stage, the main learning I want to highlight is the amazing potential of the global delivery model. McKC was created to drive cost efficiencies and increase productivity. However, when we added high-quality talent to the mix and gave them an entrepreneurial culture to flourish in, the impact was explosive. We brought talent at McKC with significantly higher capabilities than what we traditionally had in the research function at McKinsey. It took some time for this talent to build domain understanding and grown in maturity, but when that happened it changed the scope of McKC dramatically. It evolved into an innovation centre and allowed McKinsey to experiment with and build new capabilities, which it could not have otherwise. This ability to increase innovation capacity leveraging the global delivery model is a great opportunity for enterprises in the digital age.\n",

But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.”\nThere’s an economic theory out there that if you take the incomes of your five closest friends and average them, the resulting number will be pretty close to your own income.\nYou’re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.\nYour job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.\n“Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.”\nInstead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch.\nThe great thing about dead or remote masters is that they can’t refuse you as an apprentice. You can learn whatever you want from them. They left their lesson plans in their work.\nSchool is one thing. Education is another. The two don’t always overlap. Whether you’re in school or not, it’s always your job to get yourself an education.\nYou have to be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else—that’s how you’ll get ahead.\nGoogle everything. I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don’t ask a question before you Google it. You’ll either find the answer or you’ll come up with a better question.\nAlways be reading. Go to the library. There’s magic in being surrounded by books. Get lost in the stacks. Read bibliographies. It’s not the book you start with, it’s the book that book leads you to.\nCollect books, even if you don’t plan on reading them right away. Filmmaker John Waters has said, “Nothing is more important than an unread library.”\n“Whether I went to school or not, I would always study.”\nCarry a notebook and a pen with you wherever you go. Get used to pulling it out and jotting down your thoughts and observations. Copy your favourite passages out of books. Record overheard conversations. Doodle when you’re on the phone.\n“It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.”\nDon’t Wait Until You Know Who You Are to Get Started If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started “being creative,” well, I’d still be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are.\nGuess what: None of us do. Ask anybody doing truly creative work, and they’ll tell you the truth: They don’t know where the good stuff comes from. They just show up to do their thing. Every day.\nCopying is about reverse-engineering. It’s like a mechanic taking apart a car to see how it works.\n“Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.”\nFirst, you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you have to figure out what to copy.\nIf you copy from one author, it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it’s research.\nWhat to copy is a little bit trickier. Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes.\n“We want you to take from us. We want you, at first, to steal from us, because you can’t steal. You will take what we give you and you will put it in your own voice and that’s how you will find your voice. And that’s how you begin. And then one day someone will steal from you.”\n“It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.”\nSo: Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short. What’s in there that makes you different? That’s what you should amplify and transform into your own work.\nWrite the Book You Want to Read “My interest in making music has been to create something that does not exist that I would like to listen to. I wanted to hear music that had not yet happened, by putting together things that suggested a new thing which did not yet exist.”\nThe best advice is not to write what you know, it’s to write what you like.\nWhen we love a piece of work, we’re desperate for more. We crave sequels. Why not channel that desire into something productive?\nThe manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done.\nUse Your Hands “We don’t know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops.” - John Cleese\nThe computer brings out the uptight perfectionist in us—we start editing ideas before we have them. The cartoonist Tom Gauld says he stays away from the computer until he’s done most of the thinking for his strips, because once the computer is involved, “things are on an inevitable path to being finished. Whereas in my sketchbook the possibilities are endless.”\nTry it: If you have the space, set up two workstations, one analog and one digital. For your analog station, keep out anything electronic. Take $10, go to the school supply aisle of your local store, and pick up some paper, pens, and sticky notes. When you get back to your analog station, pretend it’s craft time. Scribble on paper, cut it up, and tape the pieces back together. Stand up while you’re working. Pin things on the walls and look for patterns. Spread things around your space and sort through them.\nOnce you start getting your ideas, then you can move over to your digital station and use the computer to help you execute and publish them. When you start to lose steam, head back to the analog station and play.\nSide Projects and Hobbies are Important Take time to be bored. One time I heard a co-worker say, “When I get busy, I get stupid.” Ain’t that the truth. Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. I get some of my best ideas when I’m bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners. I love ironing my shirts—it’s so boring, I almost always get good ideas. If you’re out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall for as long as you can. As the artist Maira Kalman says, “Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind.” Take time to mess around. Get lost. Wander. You never know where it’s going to lead you.\n“You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.”\nTomlinson suggests that if you love different things, you just keep spending time with them. “Let them talk to each other. Something will begin to happen.”\nMusic feeds into their work.\nA hobby is something that gives but doesn’t take. While my art is for the world to see, music is only for me and my friends. We get together every Sunday and make noise for a couple of hours. No pressure, no plans. It’s regenerative. It’s like church.\nDon’t throw any of yourself away. Don’t worry about a grand scheme or unified vision for your work. Don’t worry about unity—what unifies your work is the fact that you made it. One day, you’ll look back and it will all make sense.\nThe Secret: Do Good work and Share it with People This is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you’re doing really good work. There’s no pressure when you’re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you’re unknown, there’s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge pay check on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on. You’ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money.\nEnjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.\nYou don’t put yourself online only because you have something to say—you can put yourself online to find something to say. The Internet can be more than just a resting place to publish your finished ideas—it can also be an incubator for ideas that aren’t fully formed, a birthing center for developing work that you haven’t started yet.\nGeography is no longer out master Surround yourself with books and objects that you love. Tape things up on the wall. Create your own world.\nAlways carry a book, a pen, and a notepad, and I always enjoy my solitude and temporary captivity.\nBrain gets too comfortable in your everyday surroundings. You need to make it uncomfortable. You need to spend some time in another land, among people that do things differently than you. Travel makes the world look new, and when the world looks new, our brains work harder.\nIt helps to live around interesting people, and not necessarily people who do what you do. I feel a little incestuous when I hang out with only writers and artists, so I enjoy the many filmmakers, musicians, and tech geeks who live in Austin. Oh, and food. The food should be good. You have to find a place that feeds you—creatively, socially, spiritually, and literally.\nBe Nice “Find the most talented person in the room, and if it’s not you, go stand next to him. Hang out with him. Try to be helpful.”\nIf you ever find that you’re the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room.\nSo go on, get angry. But keep your mouth shut and go do your work. “Complain about the way other people make software by making software.”\nSo, I recommend public fan letters. The Internet is really good for this. Write a blog post about someone’s work that you admire and link to their site. Make something and dedicate it to your hero. Answer a question they’ve asked, solve a problem for them, or improve on their work and share it online.\nThe trouble with creative work: Sometimes by the time people catch on to what’s valuable about what you do, you’re either a) bored to death with it, or b) dead. You can’t go looking for validation from external sources. Once you put your work into the world, you have no control over the way people will react to it.\nNot everybody will get it. People will misinterpret you and what you do. They might even call you names. So get comfortable with being misunderstood, disparaged, or ignored—the trick is to be too busy doing your work to care.\nLife is a lonely business, often filled with discouragement and rejection. Yes, validation is for parking, but it’s still a tremendous boost when people say nice things about our work.\nInstead of keeping a rejection file, keep a praise file. Use it sparingly—don’t get lost in past glory—but keep it around for when you need the lift.\nBe Boring “It’s better to burn out than to fade away.”\nThe truth is that even if you’re lucky enough to make a living off doing what you truly love, it will probably take you a while to get to that point. Until then, you’ll need a day job. A day job gives you money, a connection to the world, and a routine. Freedom from financial stress also means freedom in your art.\nThe trick is to find a day job that pays decently, doesn’t make you want to vomit, and leaves you with enough energy to make things in your spare time. Good day jobs aren’t necessarily easy to find, but they’re out there.\nThe artist Saul Steinberg said, “What we respond to in any work of art is the artist’s struggle against his or her limitations.” It’s often what an artist chooses to leave out that makes the art interesting. What isn’t shown versus what is. It’s the same for people: What makes us interesting isn’t just what we’ve experienced, but also what we haven’t experienced. The same is true when you do your work: You must embrace your limitations and keep moving. In the end, creativity isn’t just the things we choose to put in, it’s the things we choose to leave out. Choose wisely. And have fun.\n",

How to Avoid Loss in the Stock Market Not actionable item here.\nOn the contrary, the interesting fact is that almost all billionaires in the world have created their fortune through the stock market, either directly or indirectly. “Directly” refers to the direct stock investing and “Indirectly” refers to listing their companies on the stock market. One of the world’s richest persons, Warren Buffet created his fortune from direct stock investing while other well-known billionaires like Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook), Larry Page (founder of Google) made their fortune by listing their companies on stock market. Even in India, you will find many billionaire investors (e.g. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala) who created their entire wealth from direct stock investing.\nAs per statistics, 80% retail investors suffer overall loss from equity investment. Now, the most important point that arises is why maximum retail investors (small investors) lose their hard earned money in this market while a group of people are creating their fortune?\nNet Profit and loss calculation from trading\n1st Transaction 2nd Transaction Buy Rate 100 100 This is one of the most important reasons of losing money in trading. The odds are against you. The system is designed in such a manner that it is next to impossible to make money consistently. Brokers, stock exchange and government – only they can earn consistently from trading. Every time you trade you need to pay all of them. They don’t bother whether you are gaining or losing. I hope now the reason is clear why your broker, media and several websites always encourage you to trade frequently. They all want to earn money for themselves, not for you. Do you still want to make them richer?\nThe reality is that during the bear market, quality stocks are available at a cheap rate, and thus it is one of the best times to invest. Moreover, if you select quality stocks then overall market movement rarely matters. High-quality businesses are always poised to do well in any market situation. Don’t get carried away by any analysts.\nOverconfidence\nSuppose, you started investing during a bull market and successfully earned 45% return at the end of first year. All your purchased stocks were performing well. In such a situation, you may start thinking that you have mastered the subject very well. As the market moves up, so moves your confidence level, you keep on increasing your investment amount. You are now too aggressive. Suddenly market crashes and there comes a prolonged bear market. It is the bear market that separates intelligent investors from others. Don’t get lured and invest aggressively if you find your portfolio giving above average return during a bull market. The stock market doesn’t move linearly. It’s quite easy to make money during the bull run but difficult during the bear period. To become a successful investor, you need to learn the art of making money across all market situations.\nThe only way to earn consistently from the stock market is to invest in the great business and hold them for the appropriate period. Check the details of any billionaire equity investor across the world. You will find one thing common to them. They simply chose high-quality stocks and remained invested over the long run. Warren Buffett, world’s most successful investor, and one of the world’s richest persons, created his fortune from 22% annualized return over more than 50 years from equity investing. He didn’t jump into intraday or Futures and Options. Just think, 22% annualized return consistently over 50 years creates a billionaire, and these trading tips providers claim 50%+ monthly return! What do you say?\nForget about intraday; short term trading, Futures \u0026 Options. Remember, there is no shortcut to earning quickly. Every quick-money makings tricks are eventually money-losing tricks. Investing in high-quality stocks and holding them for the correct period is the only way to create wealth. This statement is easier to say than to execute. Here come the obvious questions\nWhat do you mean by “high-quality stocks”? How to select high-quality stocks? How to separate quality business from others? What is the correct holding period? When to buy and when to sell a stock? How to construct my portfolio? Point to Remember\nThe only way to accumulate wealth from the stock market is to invest in high-quality business (stock) and hold the same for the long run. You can’t make money consistently via any form of short term trading. (Intraday, Futures \u0026 Options, margin trade, etc.) Your broker, stock exchange, and government can only become rich from short-term trading. Don’t get tempted by fancy stories in the stock market. Don’t invest in stocks with borrowed money. It carries a significant amount of risk. 2. Stock Market is Not Risky at All Not actionable item here.\nFor the person in the highest tax bracket, it is as high as 30.9%! Even if you are in the lowest tax bracket, then you need to shell out around 10% tax on the interest income from bank’s fixed deposit.\nWell, many tax-efficient debt investment options are there which offers steady return and also serve the purpose of diversification. The problem is many of us are not aware at all.\nIrrespective of educational background and specialization, anyone can learn the tactics of successful investing. It’s simple but not easy. “Simple” in the sense that it doesn’t require high intellectual. “Not easy” because it requires years of practice, discipline, dedication and willingness to learn.\nHistorically it is proved that only stock market and real estate investment can offer an above-inflation return in the long run.\nSurprisingly in the stock market, investors are ready to trade frequently. A mere 10% rise in stock price tempts to book profit while 10% drop in stock price creates panic. The more you trade the chances of losing money will widen. If you can consider yourself as a partial owner of the business, then you can restrict yourself from frequent trading.\nMore than “what to do” you need to learn “what NOT to do”.\nPoints to remember\nEquity investing is not risky rather staying away from equity investment is risky. After adjusting tax and inflation, bank’s fixed deposit yield a negative return. Equity investment is the most convenient option for long-term wealth creation. Investment in stocks is just like driving a car. If you can master the subject, it becomes easier. Lack of knowledge is the primary reason for widespread misconception and lowest retail participants in the stock market. A stock is nothing but a partial ownership in the business. Treat yourself as an owner of the business. Before considering equity investment, invest in knowledge. Investment in knowledge pays the best interest. 3. Fist Step of Picking Winning Stocks Points to remember and Actionable items.\nNow, here is the big question - if we should put the least priority on profit and sales growth numbers then what will be our priority? The answer is Return on Equity (ROE). As a shareholder, you need to follow how promoters are utilising shareholder’s money. Are they creating value for their shareholders or themselves? Let’s have a look at the details of Return on Equity.\nHowever, Return on Equity (ROE) offers an approximate view. Increasing ROE over the last 5-10 years with improved operating margin and cash flow is a signal of sustaining economic moat.\nDebt to equity ratio is the measure of a company’s financial leverage calculated by dividing its total liabilities by stockholders’ equity. It indicates what proportion of equity and debt the company is using to finance its assets. So, debt to equity ratio = Total Liabilities/Equity.\nBefore investing in any stock, have a look on its debt to equity ratio. The ratio is available on various financial websites. You need to check the ratio for at least last three years. Debt to equity ratio of greater than 1 (and increasing continuously) carries red signal. It emphasises that the company may face difficulties to serve debt in the near future. Don’t invest in companies where the ratio is above 1 and increasing rapidly over the last few years. Investing in high debt companies carries inherent risk. (Also note, debt to equity ratio is not relevant for banking and NBFC companies. There are different set of ratios for analysing banking and NBFC companies). In the following chart let’s have a look at the companies having high debt to equity ratio and their stock price performance.\nAfter getting any stock idea, just figure out its Return on Equity (ROE) and Debt to Equity ratio. Profit and sales growth analysis will come later on. If you find the stock having ROE of less than 12% (and decreasing) and debt to equity ratio of more than 1 (and increasing), then discard it.\nPoints To Remember\nCompanies can alter profit and sales figures. So, the priority should not be on the profit and sales growth numbers. There are plenty of stock recommendations are available here and there. Before following any of them just conduct a basic test of your own. Return on Equity (ROE) is the single most important parameter to analyse a stock. Considering all other parameters remain same, higher the ROE better is the investment option. Investing in companies with wide economic moat during their early stage can generate a multibagger return. Companies can create economic moat by offering better products/service or utilising their brand strength or locking customers from competitors. Increasing ROE over the last 5-10 years with improved operating margin and cash flow is a prominent signal of economic moat. It is highly recommended to avoid high debt companies. Avoid stocks having debt to equity ratio more than 1 (increasing) and ROE less than 12% (decreasing over the last few years). Higher debt translates into higher interest outgo that eventually minimises profits and erodes shareholders value. Actionable Companies can alter profit and sales figures. So, the priority should not be on the profit and sales growth numbers. Return on Equity (ROE) is the single most important parameter to analyse a stock. Considering all other parameters remain same, higher the ROE better is the investment option. Investing in companies with wide economic moat during their early stage can generate a multibagger return.

Avoid stocks having debt to equity ratio more than 1 (increasing) and ROE less than 12% (decreasing over the last few years). 4. How to Evaluate Management We all know that good management can turn around a poor business while poor management can ruin the quality business.\nI am going to present the simplest way for getting an idea about the management credibility. From the comfort of your home, you can evaluate those simple and easy-to-understand methods! Only three inputs are required for our purpose\nShareholding Pattern Dividend History and Tax Rate Return on Equity (ROE) Promoters and Promoter Group\nPromoters are those who incorporated the company. They can be either domestic or foreign entity (or group of individuals). Relatives of promoters owning shares also come under promoter group.\nPublic Group\nShareholders other than promoters constitute Public shareholding pattern. FIIs, DIIs, banks, money managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, individuals, etc. come under this group.\nRemember, the shareholding pattern in isolation is not sufficient enough for taking any investment decision.\nPromoters increasing their stake\nIt feels like; you are not the lone buyer, owners of the company are also buying just like you from the open market. So, just go ahead.\nFor the retail investor, it is not mandatory to dig dipper on “Why Promoters are increasing their stake?” because whatever be the reason the result would be positive (mostly).\nIncreasing promoter holdings either results in price appreciation or downside protection of the stock. If the promoters raise their stake, it is comprehended that they has high confidence in the business.\nPromoters decreasing their stake\nPromoters decreasing their stake can have either positive or negative effect on the stock price. Forced selling by promoters might cause major crash in the stock price. I will discuss the “forced selling” in the latter part of this chapter. Prior to that let’s have a look from different angle\nTry to avoid companies where promoters have small shareholdings or they are consistently reducing their stake by a huge percentage.\nHowever, reducing promoters’ stake is always not bad. The reason behind this is that even promoters have the right to enjoy the profit of their company. It is nothing bad in it if they sell some part of their stake. Moreover, they are in the business for earning money, and they have been working for it since 10-15-20 or even 50 years!!! For an example, promoters of Page Industries were reducing their stake during 2012-2015; still the stock price was appreciated by more than 200% during the same time. One of my investment, Atul Auto is another example. During November, 2013 promoters reduced their stake. Initially, I was worried; however detailed analysis revealed that one of the promoters sold his partial holding to an institutional investor. Initial entry of big institutional investor is the first sign of good times. I had increased my stake based on the entry of the institutional investor. The result paid off. Within the next one year, the stock generated 150%+ return!\nSo, you need to dig deeper whenever promoters are reducing their stake. It may have a negative or positive effect. Don’t take the decision based on the numbers. You need to dig deeper for the real picture behind numbers.\nFII\nHigher FIIs stake is interpreted as positive, and a lower FII stake means low confidence of FIIs in the company. If FIIs increase their stake, it is considered positive as they invest funds only when they are optimistic and confident about the future of the company.\nJust like promoters, If FIIs sell their shares then it does not mean that the company is fundamentally weak. Their selling may be due to the economic or political changes, legal problems in their home country or it’s just that they want to enjoy their profit. Whatever be the reason, if they offload massive quantities then a huge fall in stock price is witnessed.\nKey of multibagger return\nThe key to successful investing lies in identifying a stock that can become favourite among FIIs in the near future. In such case stock price multiplied by 3-4 times or more within 1-2 years. For example, I had invested in Ajanta Pharma during December 2012. Back then, the stock was not tracked by brokerage house. The company didn’t get enough attention from institutional investors. Slowly, with improved fundamentals, strong financial numbers and better future outlook, the company attracted institutional investors. Since December 2012 to March 2014 FII increased their stake by 3.81%, resulting in an increase of around 184% in FII holdings. No, wonder, since then, stock price generated around 500%+ return (more than six times return) within two years. So, you can create wonder if you can invest in stock before it attracts investment from FIIs (or institutional investors).\nEffects of Individual Investors\nIndividuals have the least amount of knowledge and are mostly carried with emotions. On the other side, institutional investors are the most knowledgeable (after the promoters). So, you should be cautious if increasing individual shareholdings is resulted due to a significant decrease in institutional holdings.\nPledging of Shares\nLike we take loans to fulfil our desire or necessity by mortgaging properties. Similarly, promoters also raise funds by keeping their shares as collateral. High pledging of shares is always dangerous for retail investors. It can cause a sudden crash in stock price. Let’s have a look at various aspects of pledging.\nIf any company has a pledging percentage up to 2%-8%, then it can be ignored.\nPoint to Remember\nIt is almost impossible for small investors to visist the management/factory before investing in the stock. There are alternatives for management analysis that can be done from the comfort of your home. Promoters increasing their stake from the open market purchase have very positive impact in the stock price. Promoters can decrease their stake for various reasons. It can have either postivie or negative impact on stock price. Stay away from companies where promoters plege more than 30% of their holdings (and increasing) Significant increase in institutional holdings result in sharp stock price apprecication If tax rate is not matching with profit numbers, then you need to dig deeper.

Whether you like it or not, the next 5 years, 10 years is coming. Either I can choose to regret past and be awed (OMG, it takes so much time to achieve something substantial in life), or get the best out of next 5 year, 10 years that is coming. You do not need new information — you need a new plan of action . It is time to create new behaviors and habits oriented away from sabotage and toward success . It’s that simple.\nYou need to build a System (Dance, Job Change, Growth etc.). This will be ongoing process. Keep refining it. I need to build a System for using Jonathan Levi in my Daily life. It is the most important course that I have done in 2022. Chapter 1: The Compound Effect In Action It doesn’t matter how smart you are or aren’t , you need to make up in hard work what you lack in experience , skill , intelligence , or innate ability . If your competitor is smarter , more talented , or experienced , you simply need to work three or four times as hard.\nI also need sense of direction, to work hard and work smart. If you aren’t good at something, work harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too.\nChapter 2: Choices It’s the little things in life that will bite you .\nI have not been any more lucky or unlucky than anyone else . The difference is when luck came my way, I took advantage of it.\nThe ( Complete ) Formula for Getting Lucky : Preparation (personal growth) + Attitude (belief / mindset) + Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) + Action (doing something about it) = Luck\nAttitude : This is where luck evades most people , and where Sir Richard is spot - on with his belief that luck is all around us. It’s simply a matter of seeing situations , conversations, and circumstances as fortuitous . You cannot see what you don’t look for, and you cannot look for what you don’t believe in.\nSpot on from DEFM. So no more whining about the cards you were dealt, the great defeats you suffered, or any other circumstances. Countless people have more disadvantages and greater obstacles than you , and yet they’re wealthier and more fulfilled. Luck is an equal - opportunity distributor . Lady luck shines on all , but rather than having your umbrella overhead , you’ve got to have your face to the sky When it comes down to it, it’s all you, baby. There’s no other way around it.\nWhen I learned of the wrongdoings, I chose not to lose any more time fighting it. Instead, I licked my wounds, learned my lesson, and moved on. In hindsight, I’d make the same choice to pick up and move on again today .\nTime for better job opportunities. Don’t regret past. What is gone is gone. Look forward in future. I now challenge you to do the same. No matter what has happened to you, take complete responsibility for it — good or bad, victory or defeat. Own it. My mentor Jim Rohn said, “The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you take full responsibility for your life.”\nBookmark !!!\nThis tracking exercise changed my awareness of how I related to my money. It worked so well, in fact, that I’ve used it many times to change other behaviors. Tracking is my go - to transformation model for everything that ails me. Over the years I’ve tracked what I eat and drink, how much I exercise, how much time I spend improving a skill, my number of sales calls, even the improvement of my relationships with family, friends, or my spouse. The results have been no less profound than my money - tracking wake - up call .\nTrackable - Gym Workout, Streaks Non-Trackable - Hours Spent in learning a skill. After hundreds of tournaments played and thousands of strokes tallied , the difference between the No . 1 – ranked golfer and the No . 10 golfer is an average of 0.32 strokes, but the difference in prize money is more than double ( $ 9.6 million versus $ 4.6 million ) ! The No. 1 golfer isn’t five times better, not even 50 percent or 10 percent better . In fact, his average score is only 0.5 percent better. Yet the results are more than double !\nEven though you saved for many more years and invested much more cash, you still ended up with less than a third of the money you could have had. That’s what happens when we procrastinate and neglect necessary behaviors, habits, and disciplines. Don’t wait another day to start the small disciplines that will lead you in the direction of your goals!\nThe key is to start NOW. Every great act , every fantastic adventure , starts with small steps . The first step always looks harder than it actually is.\nActionable - 2\nTracking Workout + Dance Routines. Start believing yourself being worthy, and don’t seek validation. Take responsiblity for every thing in life (Success + Failures) Chapter 3: Habits “My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life !” the teacher exclaimed. “The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to even try.”\nFrom what we’ve already discussed , you know successful people aren’t necessarily more intelligent or more talented than anyone else. But their habits take them in the direction of becoming more informed, more knowledgeable, more competent, better skilled, and better prepared.\nLike Larry Bird, you can condition your automatic and unconscious responses to be those of a developed champion . This chapter is about choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits. It’s about becoming a creature of champion habits .\nForget about willpower. It’s time for why - power. Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams. The wisest and most motivating choices are the ones aligned with that which you identify as your purpose, your core self, and your highest values. You’ve got to want something, and know why you want it , or you’ll end up giving up too easily.\nWell said. That’s why it’s not enough to choose to be successful. You have to dig deeper than that to find your core motivation, to activate your superpower. Your why - power .\nWe can all make powerful choices . We can all take back control by not blaming chance, fate, or anyone else for our outcomes. It’s within our ability to create change. Rather than letting past hurtful experiences sap our energy and sabotage our success, we can use them to fuel positive, constructive change.\nWhen you define your goals , you give your brain something new to look for and focus on. It’s as if you’re giving your mind a new set of eyes through which to see all the people , circumstances, conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you. With this new perspective(an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside — your goal. It’s that simple. The difference in how you experience the world and draw ideas, people, and opportunities into your life after you have clearly defined your goals is profound. In one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way :“Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy. And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting blanks without written goals — and that’s the starting point.”\nI suggest that you take some time today to make a list of your most important goals. I recommend considering goals in all aspects of your life, not just for your business or finances. Be wary of the high price of putting too much focus on any single aspect of your life, to the exclusion of everything else. Go for whole - life success — balance in all the aspects of life that are important to you: business, finances, health and well - being, spirituality, family and relationships, and lifestyle.\nWhen most people set out to achieve new goals, they ask, “Okay , I have my goal; now what do I need to do to get it? ” It’s not a bad question, but it’s not the first question that needs to be addressed either. The question we should be asking ourselves is : “Who do I need to become?” You probably know some people who seem to do everything right, but still don’t produce the results they want, right? Why not ? One principle Jim Rohn taught me is : “If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.”\nChapter 4: Momentum But you set yourself up for failure by doing too much too soon. Chapter 5: Influences As you might guess, I don’t watch or listen to any news and I don’t read any news feeds or news publications. Ninety - nine percent of all news has no bearing on my personal life or my personal goals, dreams, and ambitions anyway. I have set up a few RSS feeds identifying the news and industry updates that do pertain to my direct interests and goals. The news that’s helpful to me gets plucked out of the fray so I don’t have to get any mud slung into my glass of water. While most people wade through hours of irrelevant garbage that hampers their thinking and crushes their spirit, I get the most productive information I need when I need it, in less than fifteen minutes a day.\nI once had a neighbor who was deemed a three - minute friend . For three minutes, we could have a great chit - chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. I can hang out with an old high - school friend for three hours, but he’s not a three - day guy And, then there are some people I can hang around for a few days, but wouldn’t go on an extended vacation with. Take a look at your relationships. Make sure you’re not spending three hours with a three - minute person.\nYou have to let go of some people from you life. They just seem to be very different from the way you are. They have different dreams, different aspirations, different life journeys. Make peace with reality and enjoy your journey. When I push too hard I push him/her away. I am actually trying to help myself, and not the other way round. VP You, too , can have almost any mentor you want, if he or she has gathered their best thoughts, stories, and ideas into books, videos, and podcasts . You have an unlimited bounty from which to draw. Take advantage of it. Now people often reach out to my assistant in order to get my advice or mentorship. All she has to do is tell them it’s all already available from anywhere in the world through DarrenDaily or inside our Darren Hardy Training Vault.\nTechnical Skills: Sergey Kargopolov, Stephane Marek Soft Skills: Dan Appleman, Josh Paulsen, Jonathan Levi, Jarad Hill If you want to have a better, deeper, more meaningful relationship, ask yourself, “Who has the type of relationship I want? How can I spend (more) time with that person? Who can I meet who can positively influence me?” Let their glow rub off on you. Befriend the person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful person in your field. What do they read? Where do they go for lunch? How can that association influence you? You can build these expanded associations by joining networking groups and even online communities. Find the charity organizations, symphonies, and clubs where the people you want to emulate gather.\nYou’re never too good for a mentor . My friend Harvey Mackay told me , “I have had twenty coaches, if you can believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, I have a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” I have always found it interesting that the most successful people , the truly top performers , are the ones willing to hire and pay for the best coaches and trainers there are. It pays to invest in your improved performance.\nPut another way, you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of\nIt’s amazing how life will organize around the standards you set for yourself. Some people think they’re the victims of other people’s behavior, but in actuality, we have control over how people treat us. Protect your emotional, mental, and physical space. Then you can live with peace, rather than in the chaos and stress the world will hurl upon you.\nActionable - 5 Take hard decision to move away from Toxic People, even if it mean you will be alone. Find a Mentor, follow his Tree. Hire and Pay for best coaches. Chapter 6: Acceleration But instead of quitting, every time I hit one of those mental and emotional walls, I recognized my competitors were facing the same challenges. I knew this was another moment when, if I kept going, I would gain strides ahead of them. These were the defining moments of success and progress. It wasn’t difficult, painful, or challenging when I was just running with the herd, just keeping up, but not really getting ahead. It’s not getting to the wall that counts. It’s what you do after you hit it that really matters.\nIt’s the extra effort after you have done your best that is the difference - maker. His team went on to win the game in the second half. That is how you win.\nWhen conditions are great, things are easy, there aren’t any distractions, no one is interrupting, temptations aren’t luring, and nothing is disturbing your stride. It’s not until situations are difficult, when problems come up and temptation is great, that you get to prove your worthiness for progress. As Jim Rohn would say , “Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better.”\nWhen you hit the wall in your disciplines, routines, rhythms, and consistency, realize that’s when you are separating yourself from your old self, scaling that wall and finding your more powerful, triumphant, and victorious self.\nActionable - 6 You have hit the wall. Take one more step / Scale the Wall !!! You have reached breaking point. Take a break and resume !!! Actionable Items Actionables Find and Create Memory Palace, this time only for Actionable items.

    "content": " What’s what Major challenges around file-based integration and how to prevent them Common issues that affect API integration and how to avoid them What’s what File-based integration is the communication between two systems that occurs via a file that represents the initial data source and its destination data.\nTo synchronize data with another system, file-based architecture sends a CSV file or a flat file. A CSV file can only contain a single file, whereas a flat file can combine elements from a number of files. File transfer is required when systems store data in tables; that’s often the case with e-commerce programs or legacy systems where there’s no accessible API.\nAdvanced business systems can require real-time data transmission, and that’s where API integration has the upper hand. API allows you to establish a connection between two systems with the help of cloud applications.\nYou can utilize one of them exclusively, but file-based and API integration can complement each other, depending on your company’s needs. Let’s take a closer look at the possible difficulties of each and how to overcome them.\nMajor challenges around file-based integration and how to prevent them File-based integration is mostly used in legacy systems and is much more time-consuming than API integration, that’s why developers don’t like it much. This approach presents several challenges. For example, McKinsey mentions the following ones. We offer some tips on how to avoid each of them.\nLimited exception handling on format mismatches\nSome nondigestible formats, like phone numbers, only require format normalizations. In other cases, not only format but also data would need to be standardized. There are several solutions to the problem: using an open-source universal identifier, standardizing with Excel or scripts and APIs, and utilizing standardization software depending on the data type.\nManual failure recovery following network or system outages\nTo recover lost or corrupted data, utilize the business rule management system (BRMS). One indispensable feature of this software is a sequence of reports that allow you to recover the system bit by bit. From the reports, you’ll find out how much of the system is damaged and learn a set of instructions on how to restore it. The BRMS allows you to bring back your entire system or separate items of choice, including control groups, libraries, folders, ASPs, spooled files, or integrated file system links.\nWeak controls for file tampering and man-in-the-middle breaches\nRobust security is a must to avoid data encryption by attackers, who mostly conduct such attacks to receive a ransom. Here are the ways to avert this kind of attack:\nEncrypt the stored and transmitted data first—outsmart the attackers\nEnsure snapshots are taken each time a database is modified by integrating COW (copy-on-write)\nUtilize HMAC to sign messages or files: a shared secret key will ensure the data transferred and received is authentic and unmodified by a third party\nInitiate file integrity monitoring (FIM), which checks a wide range of files, including encryption key stores, and alerts you once it detects any changes\nEstablish write once read many (WORM) systems to make sure data cannot be changed or erased accidentally or deliberately\nA man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when an actor intercepts a communication of two systems to steal data. To enhance systems against this type of attack, upgrade your website to HTTPS protocol and configure it to exclude any leftover HTTP. Also, ensure the use of TLS 1.1 and 1.2 server protocols and disable all other protocols.\nTime-consuming customer onboarding (4–6 months)\nOne way to streamline the onboarding process is to integrate an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) solution. This platform, underpinned by API, ensures apps are integrated in a standardized way, which allows onboarding automation and quick and easy data exchange across applications.\nBulky file formats for enterprise resource planning (ERP) integration, requiring customization for each company\nTo process and transfer large files, you’ll need the tools and processes to break the large data files into small enough chunks. INSART can provide you with the solutions to solve this problem in a quick and efficient way.\nHigher operating cost to run and maintain the specialized software needed\nAs we mentioned before, API integration and file-based integration can be used in parallel. Using APIs is usually more cost-efficient, because instead of amplifying the range of software used (which often requires special expertise), you can connect to another product and transfer data securely in real time.\nCommon issues that affect API integration and how to avoid them Adoption and transition bottlenecks\nTo avert confusion and delays, make sure running is easy and the process is clear. Take into consideration legacy systems and old versions and put them into the adoption context to prevent unexpected failures.\nA lack of API flexibility, consistency, and standards in services\nSwitching is expensive. That’s why it’s crucial to build the base for the future: come up with a strategy, choose only the tools you need, make the process consistent, document it, and set security standards to protect data. Also, it’s important to know what data you have and what to do with it: don’t miss an opportunity to monetize.\nBackward compatibility\nSomeone can, for instance, swap out, unknown to an integrator currently working on the integration. Everyone should be aware of the steps being followed in the integration process, so communication is key.\nTechnical debt due to legacy code with multiple layers is a whole load of extra work that hinders progress. Infrastructure as code and containerization techniques can help you avoid the problem.\nPoor security and documentation\nA lack of documentation or outdated information results in delays and lots of implementation bugs, so make sure that the process of building an API is thoroughly documented.\nUnclear integration requirements is another problem. Rather than pursuing some other purposes, put the application user first.\nSecurity vulnerabilities may lead to data breaches and losses. Ensure proper security standards and practices to save finances and business. Our materials on security can provide you with valuable insights.\nOptimizing for systems The ultimate consumer of your API will be a computer system, not a human. This means that some usual intuitions like minimizing the number of steps in a workflow don’t apply; it’s more important to make the building blocks as intuitive as possible for developers to build this computer system.\nLack of consistency in API development Define your versioning strategy carefully, as developing APIs is like developing a language; changing APIs can break the computer system built on top of it.\nAssessing usability Consider creating either a client library for the API or a dummy application that consumes the API in parallel with the API itself. This allows you to create quicker feedback loops to test the usability of your APIs.\nOther issues API design management where new apps keep being added Vague and unclear error messages Unannounced changes The backend coding that is required to integrate with existing services is a complex and time-consuming endeavor Releases only once in two months—it’s impossible for integration to catch up since it takes three weeks to three months to fix one integration\n",

But all of these controllers are in one single springboot application. And if you make a change to any of these controllers, then you have to rebuild and redeploy the entire application.\nIf we look at Microservices architecture, then here we have multiple smaller web services rather than one a large monolithic Web service. This Web services are much smaller and each service is responsible for it’s one thing for one particular business capability. One Web service is responsible for working with user resource, like, for example, create and update user details while on the Web service is responsible only to perform the email verification functionality. These Web services can also be implemented in different programming languages and the hosted on different platforms.\nMicroservices Architecture Eureka Discovery Service Account Management Microservice - Registration, Login, Authentication, User Status Spring Cloud API Gateway as a Load Balancer H2 In-Memory Database Spring Cloud API Gateway - Creating a Custom Filters, Gateway Global Filters Spring Cloud Config Server - Git Backend Spring Cloud Bus Spring Cloud Config - File System Backend Spring Cloud Config - Configuration for Multiple Microservices Spring Boot Actuator Using MySQL Instead of In-Memory Database Encryption and Decryption Microservices Communication Microservices communications - Hystrix Circuit Breaker, Resilience4j - Circuit Breaker, Resilience4j - Retry.

Meet the Spring Family\nThe Spring family all began with the creation of the Spring Framework, which was built largely in response to the complexity of developing applications using Java’s enterprise framework called J2EE, it’s now called Java EE, and the Spring Framework aimed at removing the complexity and helped to make things like web development and data access easier for developers to implement. It also aimed at reducing boilerplate code, and if you’re not familiar with what that is, it’s repetitive code that’s often needed as part of the logic, but tends to clutter the application and draw focus away from the main logic. The Spring Framework is still heavily used today, and it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. The success of the Spring Framework led to the creation of several Spring projects that were built on top of the Spring Framework, but tailored to specific needs or domains. For example, the Spring Security project was created to remove the complexity and challenges with securing a Java application, and another project, like the Spring Data project, was created to further simplify data access in Java applications. The Spring Framework and Spring projects continued to evolve and thrive, eventually resulting in the creation of a particularly impactful project called Spring Boot. Spring Boot was a real game changer. It provided a new and drastically faster way of building Spring-based applications. Up until Spring Boot, building a Spring-based application had always involved a lot of choice making, configuration, and a cumbersome deployment model. Spring Boot removed all of that by taking an opinionated view of building Spring-based applications including sensible defaults for library choices and configuration, and adding smarts for auto-detecting and auto-configuring other common configurations. It also massively simplified the deployment process and made running a Spring-based application as simple as running a single command. Lastly came the Spring Cloud project. Spring Cloud was built on top of Spring Boot and simplified the development of applications that make use of distributed architectures, such as microservice architectures, and these type of architectures often have many common patterns that are implemented, such as service discovery and distributed configuration, and Spring Cloud helped to make it easier for developers to build applications that use those patterns. Now that we’ve been introduced to the Spring family, let’s take a look at why we would want to use it.\nWhy Spring?\nSo why Spring? And oftentimes you’ll hear people asking, why would I want to use Spring? And that’s probably something you may be even thinking for yourself right now. And one of the common answers you’ll hear is that it’s a good alternative to Java EE, and while that was true in the beginning, today Spring is so much more than just an alternative to Java EE. In fact, it’s actually complimentary to Java EE and makes use of several of the standard specifications like the Java Persistence API. The question of why you would want to use Spring is a completely valid and reasonable question that actually has a very simple answer, and that’s that creating software can be hard, seriously, and Spring helps make it easier. You’ll notice that regardless of the project within the Spring family, they all share a common theme, and that’s to make developing Java applications easier. Let’s talk about some other reasons why Spring is a good choice. First, Spring is really great at being flexible, modular, and especially backwards compatible. So Spring is far from an all‑or‑nothing type of choice. In fact, you’re given the freedom to pick and choose whichever parts of Spring make the most sense for your project. And what’s really great about that is that you can be sure that the investment you’re making with Spring won’t be wasted when a new version is released. Spring also has a very large and active community, and in my opinion this is often one of the things that’s overlooked and taken for granted when assessing technologies, but it makes a huge difference. With Spring, you can be sure that there’s a wealth of knowledge that already exists out there, and if you run into a problem, it’s likely that someone else has already ran into that same problem, and they can probably help you through it. And lastly, what makes Spring a good choice is that it’s continually innovating and evolving. Being an open‑source project but fully backed by a company called Pivotal allows Spring to remain healthy and alive, while at the same time pushing the bounds of enterprise Java development. It’s not uncommon for Java’s standards or specifications to be influenced or based on ideas that originated within Spring.\n",

    "content": "Why Python? Simple to Learn\nPython is very simple to learn. Very minimal computer knowledge is required to learn and use Python. You don’t need to know the difference between computer memory and a hard drive, you don’t need to know what an operating system is, you don’t need to know what a compiler is, nor do you need to know about build systems, and you don’t need to learn any other programming languages first. Whether you’re new to computers or not, you can learn Python. Python is also built with a goal to be easy to read and understand.\nSimple to Use\nThere are several core tenets of the Python programming language that makes it simple to use. One of the first tenants contributing to Python’s ease of use is that there is usually only one way to do things. Some programming languages believe strongly in flexibility, that the developers should be able to solve a given problem in many different ways. Python is not one of these languages. Being able to solve a single problem many ways is like having a large box of building blocks without any instruction book, or it can be like sitting in front of a blank canvas and being able to paint anything you want. At times, this feeling can be very freeing. When you are first using a programming language, though, constraints are very good to have. They provide guardrails that helped guide you to a likely solution. The constraints help point you in a direction that will help you maintain your forward momentum. This single way to accomplish a task also translates to Python’s next tenant. Python focuses on simplicity. That simplicity translates to ease of use. Excess complexity introduces confusion. Let’s say you were wanting to learn to use a new device. If there are lots of knobs to turn, levers to pull, and buttons to push, it can be difficult to figure out how to use that device, but with a simplified and intuitive interface, what needs to be done becomes clear and more obvious. That’s why a language that focuses on simplicity like Python is simple to use as well. Finally, Python and its community encourages beautiful code. The focus on beauty makes it a more pleasurable experience to use. When you don’t enjoy using something, it makes it more difficult to continue using that thing. If something brings you joy, though, it increases your desire to continue using it. The Python community has come to embrace this principle when building Python features. For these reasons, and more we’ll investigate in our next module, Python is a programming language that is simple to use.\nGreat Community\nA large contributing factor to Python being simple to learn and use is thanks to support from Python’s great community. The Python community has driven many core principles into Python, which has helped it become what it is today. The community involvement can be seen directly in how Python is supported and how Python is developed as a language. The community provides great support for developing Python code. You can see this in the countless third‑party Python packages and code libraries that are available, the great third‑party tools that can be used when using Python, and much more. We will take a closer look at these later in this course. Python’s development is also conducted largely through community‑driven proposals called Python Enhancement Proposals, also known as PEPs. This process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding proposals are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community. This has enabled Python to evolve as a shared language and evolved to user’s changing needs over the many years. Many of the principles we’ve already covered in this course were arrived at as part of this process.\nHigh Demand Python continues to grow in popularity, and the ability to work with Python is a skill that’s increasing in demand in the industry. In even the recent past, when many developers thought of popular programming languages, they tended to think of Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, and perhaps even PHP. Python didn’t usually come to mind. But according to some recent Stack Overflow analysis, Python has now overtaken other languages like Java, C#, and C++ based on Stack Overflow question views. And according to PYPL, the PopularitY of Programming Language Index, Python is now the most popular programming language, with its popularity continuing to grow each year. And it doesn’t stop there. Python has the highest spectrum rating according to the recent IEEE Spectrum report, and the TIOBE index now has Python in the top three of programming languages worldwide. All this to say, there’s really no longer any denying that Python is a popular programming language and a great language to invest your time into learning.\nWidely Used Over its many years of usage, Python has continued to grow and has become increasingly powerful and capable. Python has been used anywhere from special effects in movies like Star Wars to application scripting support in the popular open source, 3D modeling application, Blender. Four areas I’ll highlight where Python has seen widespread use are web development, data science, education and learning, and scripting. As we briefly discuss each, it’s okay if you don’t understand what each area is or how Python is used within it. With these examples, I’m just aiming to emphasize that Python is widely used in many different areas.\nWeb Development The first area we’ll discuss where Python has seen growing use is in the area of web development. There are many different buckets or styles of web development. You might be developing just an HTTP or REST API and, hence, not dealing with front‑end user interfaces, just back‑end service code. Or, you might be building a full‑stack web application that touches both the client and the server. You might even be working with an out‑of‑the‑box content management system application, ERP application or an application of a different flavor. No matter which it is, though, there’s a Python solution out there for you. If you’re building APIs, you can find existing popular Python frameworks like Flask, Bottle, Pyramid or a myriad of others. And the same goes with full‑stack web development. You have popular frameworks like Django, TurboGears, web2py, and many others at your disposal. And for the full, self‑contained web applications, you can find apps like Plone, django CMS, Mezzanine, and more. Basically, no matter what type of web application you’re developing, Python is being used out there today and can likely meet your needs too.\nData Science Data science is a field that is growing in popularity with each passing week. Data science itself is an exceptionally large field. Two common areas that tend to be wrapped up in the data science field are those of big data and machine learning. Let’s take a quick look at both of them. So what is big data? As developers, we’re used to thinking of data in terms of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, but data is growing rapidly. More and more systems are needing engineers to start thinking in the terms of terabytes, petabytes or, in some cases, even exabytes. Yes, exabytes. The amount of data being generated each day is growing rapidly and shows no signs of stopping. As of 2012, 2.4 EB of new data were generated every single day. To put that in perspective, that is 2.5, followed by 18 zeros. Datasets have grown so large that existing data processing systems are unable to deal with them. New systems are needed. This is where the growing popularity of technologies like Hadoop and MapReduce are coming from. What used to be a problem faced primarily by large companies like Google or Microsoft is now starting to be faced by smaller enterprise businesses. The more data we have available to us, the more we can spot new business trends, find correlations to help prevent new diseases, combat crime, and so on. And Python is a popular programming language used in this space. Now, machine learning is not directly related to big data; however, the more data we have available to us, the more powerful machine learning becomes. So what is machine learning? Today we are surrounded by data everywhere. It comes in all forms, shapes, and sizes. It might come from large text files, or it might be generated by the actions of users. It may be the large amount of metadata available in pictures and videos, or it might be networks and graphs of relationships people have with each other. The many relationships that might exist between all this data is potentially much more complex than any single person or group of people could find. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack. So instead, algorithms are written in such a way that a computer can process all the data and find its own connections between the many different sources. Machine learning is now commonly used in several different places. It can be used to help determine whether a given piece of email is spam or not, it can be used to help detect possible network intrusions by using the vast amount of network traffic to detect what is abnormal or not, it’s used for optical character recognition to convert images of text into text data that a computer can understand and process, or it can be used for computer vision problems like face detection, object tracking, and motion tracking, and new uses for machine learning are being discovered every day.\nEducation and Learning Python is widely used in education and learning, and its popularity continues to grow in the field. Python is getting wider adoption as a language to use when teaching basic STEM skills to younger students across the world. It’s also being used as a first programming language in which to teach people programming in the first place. This usage is not just for younger students either, as Python is becoming more popular as a language to teach programming in college courses around the world as well. Python is being used as an education tool to teach people more about computing hardware as well via accessible maker devices like the Raspberry Pi and the micro:bit. Another great way Python is used in education is via Jupyter Notebooks. Sometimes the best way to learn is through interaction and exploration of what code does and the consequences of changing a given piece of code. Jupyter Notebooks, a project that grew out of the interactive Python interpreter IPython are a great way to share different topics with people and to encourage people to explore a given topic in an interactive way that can be changed in code. Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity lately, especially in the data science space, and is pushing forward the concept of interactive education, especially in computer programming.\nScripting One of the most common uses of scripting with Python is to perform administration of computers When writing scripts to administer a machine, it’s routine to work with folders and files on the machine, perhaps managing a series of log files or examining and monitoring the file system. Or we might be dealing with the configuration of apps and services. We can monitor the processes running on a system, keeping an eye on any potential runaway processes that need to be kept in check. We may even deploy a new application, deploy new versions of an existing application or remove older applications that are no longer used. Python supports performing any of these tasks. The main limit is our imagination. We have full access to the wide variety of Python libraries that are already out there or that we are creating from scratch. The last area we’ll discuss is application scripting. One way to think of application scripting is to think about how we typically think of an application itself. As a user, we typically don’t think of an application as something that can be easily extended by us. The application is exactly what we’re given, no more, no less. But what if a user or developer could write their own code to respond to events that are raised within the application, or, going even further, what if a developer could write their own user interface elements, new screens, new user flows or something else and integrate it directly into the application itself? Not many applications written today take advantage of how powerful a concept this is. Games are one type of application that this is more common, but it’s less common to find this in your typical application outside of that area. But this is exactly what application scripting aims to do, and is one area Python can be used to a powerful degree. You can find it in 2D and 3D modeling software, image manipulation software in the form of different image processing algorithms, photo taking applications in the form of fun overlays over pictures, and other types of applications as well.\n",
