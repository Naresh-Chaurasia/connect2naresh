Provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing readable and maintainable API tests. Integrates seamlessly with Java-based testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG. Setting up with Maven\nAdd REST-Assured dependency in your pom.xml. \u003cdependency\u003e \u003cgroupId\u003eio.rest-assured\u003c/groupId\u003e \u003cartifactId\u003erest-assured\u003c/artifactId\u003e \u003cversion\u003e5.3.0\u003c/version\u003e \u003cscope\u003etest\u003c/scope\u003e \u003c/dependency\u003e Optionally include JSON/XML path and Hamcrest matchers for assertions. HTTP Method Testing\nGET: Retrieve data from an API. POST: Send data to the server. PUT: Update existing data. DELETE: Remove data from the server. PATCH: Partially update resources. Validating Responses\nStatus Code Validate HTTP response code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found). Headers Assert presence and values of headers like Content-Type, Authorization, etc. Body Validate fields in JSON or XML response using path expressions. Authentication\nBasic Authentication Pass credentials using .auth().basic(username, password). Token-Based Authentication Use .auth().oauth2(token) for Bearer tokens (commonly used in REST APIs). Custom Headers Add custom Authorization headers when needed. Request Parameters \u0026 Payloads\nQuery Parameters Use .param(\"key\", \"value\") or .queryParam(). Path Parameters Define placeholders in the endpoint URL. Request Body Send JSON, XML, or form data as payload using .body(). Assertions with Hamcrest\nUse expressive matchers for validating response: equalTo(), hasItems(), containsString(), etc. Enables readable assertions like: then().body(\"name\", equalTo(\"John\")); Logging and Configurations\nEnable request and response logging: .log().all() or .log().body() Configure timeouts, proxies, and base URI using RestAssured.config. File Uploads/Downloads\nUpload files using .multiPart() method. Download files and validate content type, size, etc. TestNG / JUnit Integration\nUse REST-Assured inside test methods. Combine with test annotations for setup, teardown, and grouping. Create reusable test suites and CI pipelines. Best Practices and Hands-on\nUse RequestSpecification and ResponseSpecification for reusability. Externalize base URIs, endpoints, and payloads in config files or constants. Follow clear naming conventions and logging to maintain readable tests. Hands-on practice: Create CRUD tests against public APIs like https://reqres.in or your own mock server. 🚀 Projects Project 1 - Java Selenium Automation Project 2 - Java Selenium Automation Project 3 - API Automation using REST Assured Project 4 - API Automation using REST Assured 🎯 Mock Interviews 🛠️ IDE Setup Visual Studio Code IntelliJ Useful Plugins ",
